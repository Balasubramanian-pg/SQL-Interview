# 584. Find Customer Referee
#### Problem: Customers Not Referred by Customer with ID = 2

Find the names of customers who are not referred by the customer with `id = 2`.

**Tables:**

### 1. `Customer` Table

This table contains information about customers and their referrers.

| Column Name | Type    | Description                                                                 |
| ----------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`          | `int`     | Primary key, unique identifier for each customer.                           |
| `name`        | `varchar` | Name of the customer.                                                     |
| `referee_id`  | `int`     | ID of the customer who referred this customer. `NULL` if not referred. |

**Primary Key:** `id`

**Constraints:**

*   Identify customers who were not referred by the customer with `id = 2`.
*   This includes customers who were referred by someone other than customer `id = 2`, and customers who were not referred by anyone (i.e., `referee_id` is NULL).
*   Return the result table in any order.

**Example Input:**

**`Customer` Table:**

| id  | name | referee\_id |
| --- | ---- | ----------- |
| 1   | Will | null        |
| 2   | Jane | null        |
| 3   | Alex | 2           |
| 4   | Bill | null        |
| 5   | Zack | 1           |
| 6   | Mark | 2           |

**Expected Output:**

| name |
| ---- |
| Will |
| Jane |
| Bill |
| Zack |

**Explanation of Example Output:**

*   **Will (id=1):** `referee_id` is NULL, so not referred by customer 2. Included.
*   **Jane (id=2):** `referee_id` is NULL, so not referred by customer 2. Included.
*   **Alex (id=3):** `referee_id` is 2, so referred by customer 2. Excluded.
*   **Bill (id=4):** `referee_id` is NULL, so not referred by customer 2. Included.
*   **Zack (id=5):** `referee_id` is 1, so not referred by customer 2. Included.
*   **Mark (id=6):** `referee_id` is 2, so referred by customer 2. Excluded.

Therefore, the customers Will, Jane, Bill, and Zack are not referred by customer with `id = 2`.

## Understanding the Problem

We need to find customer names who:
- Were not referred by customer with ID = 2, OR
- Have no referral at all (NULL referee_id)

## Solution

```sql
SELECT name
FROM Customer
WHERE referee_id != 2 OR referee_id IS NULL;
```

## Explanation

1. **Filtering Conditions**:
   - `referee_id != 2` excludes customers referred by ID 2
   - `referee_id IS NULL` includes customers with no referral

2. **Why This Works**:
   - The query selects all customers except those where referee_id equals 2
   - It includes customers with NULL referee_id because NULL comparisons behave specially in SQL

3. **Alternative Solution** (Using COALESCE):

```sql
SELECT name
FROM Customer
WHERE COALESCE(referee_id, 0) != 2;
```

This treats NULL as 0, which is not equal to 2, so it would include them.

## Example Walkthrough

Using the sample data:
- Will (NULL referee) → included
- Jane (NULL referee) → included
- Alex (referee 2) → excluded
- Bill (NULL referee) → included
- Zack (referee 1) → included
- Mark (referee 2) → excluded

The query correctly returns the expected output.
