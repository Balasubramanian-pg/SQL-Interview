## Problem: Largest Single Number

Find the largest number that appears only once in the `MyNumbers` table. If no number appears only once, return `null`.

**Tables:**

### 1. `MyNumbers` Table

This table contains a list of numbers, potentially with duplicates.

| Column Name | Type | Description                                                                 |
| ----------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `num`         | `int`  | An integer value. This table may contain duplicate values.                   |

**Primary Key:** None (The table can contain duplicates, so there is no primary key in the traditional sense.)

**Definition of Single Number:**

A "single number" is a number that appears exactly once in the `MyNumbers` table.

**Constraints:**

*   Identify the numbers that appear only once in the `MyNumbers` table.
*   From these "single numbers", find the largest one.
*   If there are no "single numbers" in the table, return `null`.
*   Return the result in a column named `num`.

**Example Input 1:**

**`MyNumbers` Table:**

| num |
| --- |
| 8   |
| 8   |
| 3   |
| 3   |
| 1   |
| 4   |
| 5   |
| 6   |

**Expected Output 1:**

| num |
| --- |
| 6   |

**Explanation of Example Output 1:**

The numbers and their counts in `MyNumbers` table are:
*   8: 2 times
*   3: 2 times
*   1: 1 time
*   4: 1 time
*   5: 1 time
*   6: 1 time

The single numbers (appearing only once) are 1, 4, 5, and 6. The largest among these is 6. Therefore, the output is 6.

**Example Input 2:**

**`MyNumbers` Table:**

| num |
| --- |
| 8   |
| 8   |
| 7   |
| 7   |
| 3   |
| 3   |
| 3   |

**Expected Output 2:**

| num  |
| ---- |
| null |

**Explanation of Example Output 2:**

The numbers and their counts in `MyNumbers` table are:
*   8: 2 times
*   7: 2 times
*   3: 3 times

There are no numbers that appear only once in the table. Therefore, the output is `null`.

# Finding the Largest Single Number

## Procedural Decomposition

1. **Identify Single Numbers**: First find numbers that appear exactly once in the table
2. **Handle Empty Result Case**: Account for the possibility where no single numbers exist
3. **Find Maximum Value**: From the single numbers, select the largest one
4. **Return NULL if None**: Return NULL when no single numbers are found

## Approach

1. **Count Occurrences**: Use GROUP BY and HAVING to find numbers appearing exactly once
2. **Select Maximum**: Apply MAX() to the single numbers
3. **Handle NULL Case**: Use a subquery or conditional logic to return NULL when appropriate

## Solution

```sql
SELECT MAX(num) AS num
FROM (
    SELECT num
    FROM MyNumbers
    GROUP BY num
    HAVING COUNT(*) = 1
) AS single_numbers;
```

**Explanation**:
- The inner query groups numbers and filters for those appearing exactly once (COUNT = 1)
- The outer query selects the maximum value from these single numbers
- If no single numbers exist, MAX() returns NULL automatically

## Alternative Approaches

### Using Common Table Expression (CTE)

```sql
WITH SingleNumbers AS (
    SELECT num
    FROM MyNumbers
    GROUP BY num
    HAVING COUNT(*) = 1
)
SELECT MAX(num) AS num FROM SingleNumbers;
```

### Using IFNULL with Subquery

```sql
SELECT IFNULL(
    (SELECT num
     FROM MyNumbers
     GROUP BY num
     HAVING COUNT(*) = 1
     ORDER BY num DESC
     LIMIT 1),
    NULL) AS num;
```

**Key Differences**:
- The CTE version improves readability for complex queries
- The IFNULL version explicitly handles the NULL case
- All approaches have similar performance characteristics

**Performance Considerations**:
- All solutions require a full table scan to count occurrences
- The GROUP BY operation is the most computationally intensive part
- Indexes on the num column could improve performance for large tables
