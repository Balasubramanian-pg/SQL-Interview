## Problem: Authors Who Viewed Their Own Articles

Write a solution to find all authors that viewed at least one of their own articles.

Return the result table sorted by id in ascending order.

**Tables:**

### 1. `Views` Table

This table records article views by viewers, including the author of the article.

| Column Name   | Type    | Description                                                                                              |
| ----------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `article_id`    | `int`     | ID of the article viewed.                                                                             |
| `author_id`     | `int`     | ID of the author who wrote the article.                                                               |
| `viewer_id`     | `int`     | ID of the viewer who viewed the article. Note that `author_id` and `viewer_id` can be the same person. |
| `view_date`     | `date`    | Date when the article was viewed.                                                                    |

**Primary Key:** None (The table may have duplicate rows)

**Constraints:**

*   Identify authors who have viewed at least one of their own articles, meaning there exists at least one row where `author_id` is equal to `viewer_id`.
*   Return a table with a single column `id` representing the `author_id` of these authors.
*   The result table should be sorted by `id` in ascending order.
*   Ensure that each author ID appears only once in the output table (remove duplicates).

**Example Input:**

**`Views` Table:**

| article\_id | author\_id | viewer\_id | view\_date  |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 1         | 3         | 5         | 2019-08-01  |
| 1         | 3         | 6         | 2019-08-02  |
| 2         | 7         | 7         | 2019-08-01  |
| 2         | 7         | 6         | 2019-08-02  |
| 4         | 7         | 1         | 2019-07-22  |
| 3         | 4         | 4         | 2019-07-21  |
| 3         | 4         | 4         | 2019-07-21  |

**Expected Output:**

| id  |
| --- |
| 4   |
| 7   |

**Explanation of Example Output:**

*   **Author with id = 3:**  In all rows where `author_id` is 3, the `viewer_id` is different (5 and 6). Thus, author 3 has not viewed their own articles.
*   **Author with id = 7:** In the row with `article_id = 2`, `author_id` (7) is equal to `viewer_id` (7). Thus, author 7 has viewed their own article.
*   **Author with id = 4:** In the rows with `article_id = 3`, `author_id` (4) is equal to `viewer_id` (4). Thus, author 4 has viewed their own article.

Therefore, the authors with `id` 4 and 7 are the ones who have viewed their own articles. The output table lists these `id`s, sorted in ascending order and without duplicates.


# Solution: Authors Who Viewed Their Own Articles

## Approach
To find authors who viewed their own articles:
1. Filter records where author_id equals viewer_id (indicating self-view)
2. Select distinct author_ids to avoid duplicates
3. Sort results by id in ascending order

## Solution
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT author_id AS id
FROM Views
WHERE author_id = viewer_id
ORDER BY id ASC;
```

## Explanation
1. `WHERE author_id = viewer_id` identifies self-views
2. `DISTINCT` ensures each author is listed only once
3. `ORDER BY id ASC` provides the required sorted output
4. The result shows unique author IDs who viewed their own articles

## Alternative Approach
Using GROUP BY instead of DISTINCT:
```sql
SELECT author_id AS id
FROM Views
WHERE author_id = viewer_id
GROUP BY author_id
ORDER BY id ASC;
```

**Key Differences**:
- Both approaches eliminate duplicates effectively
- GROUP BY might be slightly more efficient for large datasets
- Results are identical for this problem

**Performance Considerations**:
- An index on (author_id, viewer_id) would optimize the query
- The filter condition reduces the dataset significantly
- Sorting is minimal since output is just distinct IDs
