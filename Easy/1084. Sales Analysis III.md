Write a solution to report the products that were only sold in the first quarter of 2019 (between 2019-01-01 and 2019-03-31 inclusive).

Return the result table in any order.

**Tables:**

### 1. `Product` Table

**Foreign Key:** `product_id` references `Product.product_id`
**Note:** This table can have duplicate rows.

**Constraints:**

*   Identify products that have sales records only within the first quarter of 2019 (January 1st, 2019 to March 31st, 2019, inclusive).
*   Products sold in any other quarter of 2019 or in any other year should be excluded.
*   Return a table with `product_id` and `product_name` for the identified products.
*   The result table can be in any order.

**Example Input:**

**`Product` Table:**

| product\_id | product\_name | unit\_price |
| ----------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| 1         | S8          | 1000        |
| 2         | G4          | 800         |
| 3         | iPhone      | 1400        |

**`Sales` Table:**

| seller\_id | product\_id | buyer\_id | sale\_date  | quantity | price |
| ----------- | ----------- | --------- | ----------- | -------- | ----- |
| 1         | 1         | 1         | 2019-01-21  | 2        | 2000  |
| 1         | 2         | 2         | 2019-02-17  | 1        | 800   |
| 2         | 2         | 3         | 2019-06-02  | 1        | 800   |
| 3         | 3         | 4         | 2019-05-13  | 2        | 2800  |

**Expected Output:**

| product\_id | product\_name |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| 1         | S8          |

**Explanation of Example Output:**

*   **Product 1 (S8):**  Sold only on '2019-01-21', which is in the first quarter of 2019. Included.
*   **Product 2 (G4):** Sold on '2019-02-17' (Q1 2019) and '2019-06-02' (Q2 2019). Sold outside Q1 2019, so excluded.
*   **Product 3 (iPhone):** Sold on '2019-05-13' (Q2 2019). Sold outside Q1 2019, so excluded.

Only product 'S8' was sold exclusively in the first quarter of 2019.


# Solution: Products Sold Only in Q1 2019

## Approach
To find products sold exclusively in Q1 2019 (Jan 1 - Mar 31):
1. Identify products sold during Q1 2019
2. Exclude products sold outside this period
3. Return the qualifying product details

## Solution
```sql
SELECT p.product_id, p.product_name
FROM Product p
WHERE p.product_id IN (
    -- Products sold in Q1 2019
    SELECT product_id
    FROM Sales
    WHERE sale_date BETWEEN '2019-01-01' AND '2019-03-31'
)
AND p.product_id NOT IN (
    -- Products sold outside Q1 2019
    SELECT product_id
    FROM Sales
    WHERE sale_date NOT BETWEEN '2019-01-01' AND '2019-03-31'
);
```

## Explanation
1. The first subquery finds products sold during Q1 2019
2. The second subquery excludes products sold at any other time
3. Only products meeting both conditions are returned
4. We join with Product table to get product names

## Alternative Approach
Using aggregation:
```sql
SELECT p.product_id, p.product_name
FROM Product p
JOIN Sales s ON p.product_id = s.product_id
GROUP BY p.product_id, p.product_name
HAVING MIN(s.sale_date) >= '2019-01-01' 
   AND MAX(s.sale_date) <= '2019-03-31';
```

**Key Differences**:
- The first solution is more explicit about inclusion/exclusion criteria
- The aggregation version checks date ranges directly
- Both correctly identify products sold only in Q1 2019

**Performance Considerations**:
- An index on sale_date would benefit both solutions
- The NOT IN version might perform better with few exclusions
- The aggregation version scans Sales table only once
