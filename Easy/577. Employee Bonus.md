# 577. Employee Bonus

Report the name and bonus amount of each employee with a bonus less than 1000.

**Tables:**

### 1. `Employee` Table

This table contains information about employees, their supervisors, and salaries.

| Column Name | Type    | Description                                                                 |
| ----------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `empId`       | `int`     | Primary key, unique identifier for each employee.                           |
| `name`        | `varchar` | Name of the employee.                                                     |
| `supervisor`  | `int`     | ID of the employee's supervisor (manager). `NULL` if no supervisor.     |
| `salary`      | `int`     | Salary of the employee.                                                   |

**Primary Key:** `empId`

### 2. `Bonus` Table

This table contains information about employee bonuses.

| Column Name | Type | Description                                                              |
| ----------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `empId`       | `int`  | Primary key, foreign key referencing `empId` in the `Employee` table. |
| `bonus`       | `int`  | Bonus amount for the employee.                                         |

**Primary Key:** `empId`
**Foreign Key:** `empId` references `Employee.empId`

**Constraints:**

*   Report employees who have a bonus amount less than 1000.
*   If an employee does not have a bonus in the `Bonus` table, consider their bonus as NULL (and they should be included if NULL is considered less than 1000 in this context).
*   Return the result table in any order.

**Example Input:**

**`Employee` Table:**

| empId | name   | supervisor | salary |
| ----- | ------ | ---------- | ------ |
| 3     | Brad   | null       | 4000   |
| 1     | John   | 3          | 1000   |
| 2     | Dan    | 3          | 2000   |
| 4     | Thomas | 3          | 4000   |

**`Bonus` Table:**

| empId | bonus |
| ----- | ----- |
| 2     | 500   |
| 4     | 2000  |

**Expected Output:**

| name | bonus |
| ---- | ----- |
| Brad | null  |
| John | null  |
| Dan  | 500   |

**Explanation of Example Output:**

*   **Brad (empId=3):**  Not present in the `Bonus` table, so bonus is considered NULL. NULL is treated as less than 1000, so Brad is included.
*   **John (empId=1):** Not present in the `Bonus` table, so bonus is considered NULL. NULL is treated as less than 1000, so John is included.
*   **Dan (empId=2):** Bonus is 500, which is less than 1000. Dan is included.
*   **Thomas (empId=4):** Bonus is 2000, which is not less than 1000. Thomas is excluded.

## Understanding the Problem

We need to find all employees who either:
1. Have a bonus less than 1000, OR
2. Don't have a bonus record at all (NULL bonus)

## Solution

```sql
SELECT 
    e.name,
    b.bonus
FROM 
    Employee e
LEFT JOIN 
    Bonus b ON e.empId = b.empId
WHERE 
    b.bonus < 1000 OR b.bonus IS NULL;
```

## Explanation

1. **LEFT JOIN**:
   - We use a LEFT JOIN to include all employees from the Employee table
   - This ensures employees without bonus records are still included (with NULL bonus)

2. **Filtering**:
   - `b.bonus < 1000` catches employees with small bonuses
   - `b.bonus IS NULL` catches employees without bonus records

3. **Result Columns**:
   - We select the employee name and their bonus amount (which may be NULL)

## Alternative Solution (Using COALESCE)

For databases where NULL handling differs, you could use:

```sql
SELECT 
    e.name,
    b.bonus
FROM 
    Employee e
LEFT JOIN 
    Bonus b ON e.empId = b.empId
WHERE 
    COALESCE(b.bonus, 0) < 1000;
```

This treats NULL bonuses as 0, which is less than 1000, so it would include them.

## Example Walkthrough

Using the sample data:
- Brad (no bonus) → NULL → included
- John (no bonus) → NULL → included
- Dan (bonus 500) → 500 → included
- Thomas (bonus 2000) → 2000 → excluded

The query correctly returns the expected output.
