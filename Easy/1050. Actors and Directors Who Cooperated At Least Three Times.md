## Problem: Actors and Directors Who Cooperated At Least Three Times

Write a solution to find all pairs of `(actor_id, director_id)` where an actor has cooperated with a director at least three times. Cooperation is indicated by entries in the `ActorDirector` table.

Return the result table in any order.

**Tables:**

### 1. `ActorDirector` Table

This table records collaborations between actors and directors.

| Column Name | Type    | Description                                                                 |
| ----------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `actor_id`    | `int`     | ID of the actor.                                                            |
| `director_id` | `int`     | ID of the director.                                                         |
| `timestamp`   | `int`     | Primary key, timestamp of the collaboration event. Unique for each collaboration record. |

**Primary Key:** `timestamp`

**Constraints:**

*   Identify pairs of `(actor_id, director_id)` that appear 3 or more times in the `ActorDirector` table.
*   Return a table with two columns: `actor_id` and `director_id`.
*   The result table can be in any order.

**Example Input:**

**`ActorDirector` Table:**

| actor\_id | director\_id | timestamp   |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| 1         | 1         | 0           |
| 1         | 1         | 1           |
| 1         | 1         | 2           |
| 1         | 2         | 3           |
| 1         | 2         | 4           |
| 2         | 1         | 5           |
| 2         | 1         | 6           |

**Expected Output:**

| actor\_id | director\_id |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 1         | 1         |

**Explanation of Example Output:**

*   **Pair (1, 1):** Appears 3 times in the table (timestamps 0, 1, 2).  Included in the output.
*   **Pair (1, 2):** Appears 2 times in the table (timestamps 3, 4). Excluded.
*   **Pair (2, 1):** Appears 2 times in the table (timestamps 5, 6). Excluded.

# Solution: Frequent Actor-Director Collaborations

## Approach
To find actor-director pairs who have worked together at least three times, we need to:
1. Group records by both actor_id and director_id
2. Count the number of collaborations for each pair
3. Filter for pairs with a count of 3 or more

## Solution
```sql
SELECT actor_id, director_id
FROM ActorDirector
GROUP BY actor_id, director_id
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 3;
```

## Explanation
1. `GROUP BY actor_id, director_id` creates groups for each unique actor-director combination
2. `COUNT(*)` calculates how many times each pair has worked together
3. `HAVING COUNT(*) >= 3` filters to only include pairs with 3 or more collaborations
4. The result shows just the actor and director IDs for qualifying pairs

## Alternative Approach
Using a subquery with COUNT:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT actor_id, director_id
FROM ActorDirector
WHERE (actor_id, director_id) IN (
    SELECT actor_id, director_id
    FROM ActorDirector
    GROUP BY actor_id, director_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) >= 3
);
```

**Key Differences**:
- The first solution is more straightforward and efficient
- The alternative uses a subquery which might be less optimal
- Both solutions correctly handle the timestamp primary key (counting all records)

**Performance Considerations**:
- The GROUP BY solution is typically more efficient
- No indexes needed beyond the primary key for this query
- Both solutions would perform well on moderately sized tables
Only the pair `(actor_id=1, director_id=1)` has cooperated at least three times.
