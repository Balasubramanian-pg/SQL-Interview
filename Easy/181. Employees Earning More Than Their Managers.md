# 181. Employees Earning More Than Their Managers
**1. The Question**

Given a table named `Employee` which contains information about employees, including their ID, name, salary, and the ID of their manager, the task is to find and list the names of all employees whose salary is strictly greater than the salary of their direct manager.

**Table Schema:**

```
Employee
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |  -- Primary Key
| name        | varchar |
| salary      | int     |
| managerId   | int     |  -- Foreign Key referencing Employee(id)
+-------------+---------+
```

**Example Input:**

```
Employee table:
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
| id | name  | salary | managerId |
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
| 1  | Joe   | 70000  | 3         |
| 2  | Henry | 80000  | 4         |
| 3  | Sam   | 60000  | Null      |
| 4  | Max   | 90000  | Null      |
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
```

**Desired Output:**

```
+----------+
| Employee |
+----------+
| Joe      |
+----------+
```

**Explanation for Example:**
* Joe's salary (70000) is greater than his manager Sam's salary (60000).
* Henry's salary (80000) is not greater than his manager Max's salary (90000).
* Sam and Max do not have managers, so they cannot be included in the result.

**2. The Approach**

1.  **Identify the Core Comparison:** We need to compare an employee's salary with their manager's salary.
2.  **Accessing Both Sets of Data:** Since both the employee and the manager are rows within the *same* `Employee` table, we need a way to access two different rows from this table simultaneously for comparison.
3.  **Self-Join:** The standard technique for this is a `SELF JOIN`. We will join the `Employee` table with itself.
4.  **Aliasing:** To distinguish between the employee's record and the manager's record in the join, we must use table aliases. Let's use `e` for the employee and `m` for the manager.
5.  **Join Condition:** The link between an employee and their manager is the `managerId` column in the employee's row, which corresponds to the `id` column in the manager's row. So, the `JOIN` condition will be `e.managerId = m.id`.
    * Using an `INNER JOIN` (or just `JOIN`) here implicitly handles employees without managers (`managerId` is NULL), as the join condition `e.managerId = m.id` will not be met for NULL values.
6.  **Filtering Condition:** The requirement is that the employee's salary must be greater than the manager's salary. This translates to the `WHERE` clause: `e.salary > m.salary`.
7.  **Selecting the Output:** The problem asks for the names of the employees. So, we select `e.name`.
8.  **Output Column Name:** The desired output column name is `Employee`. We use an alias `AS Employee` for the selected column.

**3. The Answer (SQL Solution)**

```sql
SELECT
    e.name AS Employee  -- Select the employee's name and alias the column as 'Employee'
FROM
    Employee e          -- Alias the Employee table as 'e' (representing the employee)
JOIN
    Employee m          -- Alias the Employee table as 'm' (representing the manager)
ON
    e.managerId = m.id  -- Join condition: Link employee to their manager using managerId and id
WHERE
    e.salary > m.salary; -- Filter condition: Keep only rows where the employee's salary is greater than the manager's salary
```
