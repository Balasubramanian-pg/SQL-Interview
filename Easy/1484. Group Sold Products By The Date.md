## Question: Find Number of Products Sold and Product Names for Each Date

**Table Schemas:**

**Table: `Activities`**

```markdown
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| sell_date   | date    |
| product     | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
```

*   There is no primary key for this table. It may contain duplicates.
*   Each row of this table contains the product name and the date it was sold in a market.

**Problem Statement:**

Write a solution to find for each date the number of different products sold and their names.

The sold products names for each date should be sorted lexicographically.

Return the result table ordered by `sell_date`.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

**Input:**

**`Activities` table:**

```markdown
+------------+------------+
| sell_date  | product     |
+------------+------------+
| 2020-05-30 | Headphone  |
| 2020-06-01 | Pencil     |
| 2020-06-02 | Mask       |
| 2020-05-30 | Basketball |
| 2020-06-01 | Bible      |
| 2020-06-02 | Mask       |
| 2020-05-30 | T-Shirt    |
+------------+------------+
```

**Output:**

```markdown
+------------+----------+------------------------------+
| sell_date  | num_sold | products                     |
+------------+----------+------------------------------+
| 2020-05-30 | 3        | Basketball,Headphone,T-shirt |
| 2020-06-01 | 2        | Bible,Pencil                 |
| 2020-06-02 | 1        | Mask                         |
+------------+----------+------------------------------+
```

**Explanation:**

*   For `2020-05-30`, Sold items were (Headphone, Basketball, T-shirt), we sort them lexicographically and separate them by a comma.
*   For `2020-06-01`, Sold items were (Pencil, Bible), we sort them lexicographically and separate them by a comma.
*   For `2020-06-02`, the Sold item is (Mask), we just return it.

# SQL Solution for Products Sold by Date

Here's the solution to find the number of different products sold and their names for each date:

```sql
SELECT 
    sell_date,
    COUNT(DISTINCT product) AS num_sold,
    GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT product ORDER BY product SEPARATOR ',') AS products
FROM 
    Activities
GROUP BY 
    sell_date
ORDER BY 
    sell_date;
```

## Explanation:

1. **GROUP BY**: Groups the data by `sell_date` to aggregate products sold on each date.

2. **COUNT(DISTINCT product)**: Counts the number of unique products sold on each date.

3. **GROUP_CONCAT**: 
   - Combines all distinct product names for each date
   - `ORDER BY product` ensures lexicographical sorting
   - `SEPARATOR ','` adds commas between product names

4. **ORDER BY sell_date**: Returns results in chronological order as required.

## Key Features:
- Handles duplicate products (using DISTINCT)
- Properly formats the product list with comma separation
- Sorts both the dates and product names as specified
- Matches the exact output format shown in the example

## Note:
- `GROUP_CONCAT` is available in MySQL. For other databases:
  - PostgreSQL: Use `STRING_AGG(DISTINCT product, ',' ORDER BY product)`
  - SQL Server: Use `STRING_AGG` with a subquery to first get distinct sorted products
  - Oracle: Use `LISTAGG(DISTINCT product, ',') WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY product)`
