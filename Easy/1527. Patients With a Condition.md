## Question: Find Patients with Type I Diabetes (Repeated Question)

**Table Schemas:**

**Table: `Patients`**

```markdown
+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| patient_id   | int     |
| patient_name | varchar |
| conditions   | varchar |
+--------------+---------+
```

*   `patient_id` is the primary key for this table.
*   `conditions` contains 0 or more condition codes separated by spaces.
*   This table contains information of patients in the hospital.

**Problem Statement:**

Write a solution to find the `patient_id`, `patient_name`, and `conditions` of the patients who have Type I Diabetes. Type I Diabetes always starts with the prefix `DIAB1`.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

**Input:**

**`Patients` table:**

```markdown
+------------+--------------+--------------+
| patient_id | patient_name | conditions   |
+------------+--------------+--------------+
| 1          | Daniel       | YFEV COUGH   |
| 2          | Alice        |              |
| 3          | Bob          | DIAB100 MYOP |
| 4          | George       | ACNE DIAB100 |
| 5          | Alain        | DIAB201      |
+------------+--------------+--------------+
```

**Output:**

```markdown
+------------+--------------+--------------+
| patient_id | patient_name | conditions   |
+------------+--------------+--------------+
| 3          | Bob          | DIAB100 MYOP |
| 4          | George       | ACNE DIAB100 |
+------------+--------------+--------------+
```

**Explanation:**

Bob and George both have a condition that starts with `DIAB1`.

# SQL Solution to Find Patients with Type I Diabetes

To identify patients with Type I Diabetes (conditions starting with DIAB1), I'll use a string matching approach:

```sql
SELECT 
    patient_id,
    patient_name,
    conditions
FROM 
    Patients
WHERE 
    conditions LIKE '% DIAB1%' 
    OR conditions LIKE 'DIAB1%';
```

## Explanation:

1. **Two LIKE Conditions**:
   - `conditions LIKE 'DIAB1%'` - Finds conditions that start with "DIAB1"
   - `conditions LIKE '% DIAB1%'` - Finds conditions where "DIAB1" appears after a space (as part of multiple conditions)

2. **Why This Works**:
   - Catches both cases where DIAB1 is the first condition or appears later in the list
   - Matches the exact requirement that Type I Diabetes always starts with DIAB1 prefix
   - Returns the expected output shown in the example (patients 3 and 4)

3. **Alternative Solution** (using REGEXP for more precise matching):
   ```sql
   SELECT patient_id, patient_name, conditions
   FROM Patients
   WHERE conditions REGEXP '(^| )DIAB1';
   ```

## Output:
The query returns exactly the expected output:
```
+------------+--------------+--------------+
| patient_id | patient_name | conditions   |
+------------+--------------+--------------+
| 3          | Bob          | DIAB100 MYOP |
| 4          | George       | ACNE DIAB100 | 
+------------+--------------+--------------+
```

This solution efficiently identifies all patients with Type I Diabetes while excluding those with other conditions or no conditions.
