# 1581. Customer Who Visited but Did Not Make Any Transactions
### Question: Find Customers Who Visited Without Transactions

**Table Schemas:**

**Table: `Visits`**

```markdown
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| visit_id    | int     |
| customer_id | int     |
+-------------+---------+
```

*   `visit_id` is the column with unique values for this table.
*   This table contains information about the customers who visited the mall.

**Table: `Transactions`**

```markdown
+----------------+---------+
| Column Name    | Type    |
+----------------+---------+
| transaction_id | int     |
| visit_id       | int     |
| amount         | int     |
+----------------+---------+
```

*   `transaction_id` is column with unique values for this table.
*   This table contains information about the transactions made during the `visit_id`.

**Problem Statement:**

Write a solution to find the IDs of the customers who visited the mall but did not make any transactions and the number of times they made these types of visits.

Return the result table sorted in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

**Input:**

**`Visits` table:**

```markdown
+----------+-------------+
| visit_id | customer_id |
+----------+-------------+
| 1        | 23          |
| 2        | 9           |
| 4        | 30          |
| 5        | 54          |
| 6        | 96          |
| 7        | 54          |
| 8        | 54          |
+----------+-------------+
```

**`Transactions` table:**

```markdown
+----------------+----------+--------+
| transaction_id | visit_id | amount |
+----------------+----------+--------+
| 2              | 5        | 310    |
| 3              | 5        | 300    |
| 9              | 5        | 200    |
| 12             | 1        | 910    |
| 13             | 2        | 970    |
+----------------+----------+--------+
```

**Output:**

```markdown
+-------------+----------------+
| customer_id | count_no_trans |
+-------------+----------------+
| 54          | 2              |
| 30          | 1              |
| 96          | 1              |
+-------------+----------------+
```

**Explanation:**

*   Customer with id = 23 visited the mall once and made one transaction during the visit with id = 12.
*   Customer with id = 9 visited the mall once and made one transaction during the visit with id = 13.
*   Customer with id = 30 visited the mall once and did not make any transactions.
*   Customer with id = 54 visited the mall three times. During 2 visits they did not make any transactions, and during one visit they made 3 transactions.
*   Customer with id = 96 visited the mall once and did not make any transactions.
*   As we can see, users with IDs 30 and 96 visited the mall one time without making any transactions. Also, user 54 visited the mall twice and did not make any transactions.

# SQL Solution to Find Customers with No Transactions

Here's the solution to identify customers who visited without making any transactions and count their no-transaction visits:

```sql
SELECT 
    v.customer_id,
    COUNT(*) AS count_no_trans
FROM 
    Visits v
LEFT JOIN 
    Transactions t ON v.visit_id = t.visit_id
WHERE 
    t.transaction_id IS NULL
GROUP BY 
    v.customer_id
ORDER BY 
    count_no_trans DESC, v.customer_id;
```

## Explanation:

1. **LEFT JOIN**: We join the Visits table with Transactions to include all visits, even those without transactions.

2. **WHERE t.transaction_id IS NULL**: This filters for only the visits that don't have corresponding transactions.

3. **GROUP BY customer_id**: Groups the results by customer to count their no-transaction visits.

4. **COUNT(*) AS count_no_trans**: Counts the number of no-transaction visits for each customer.

5. **ORDER BY**: Sorts by the count in descending order (optional, as the problem allows any order).

## Output:
The query returns exactly the expected output:
```
+-------------+----------------+
| customer_id | count_no_trans |
+-------------+----------------+
| 54          | 2              |
| 30          | 1              |
| 96          | 1              |
+-------------+----------------+
```

This solution efficiently identifies customers with no transactions and counts their visits, matching all the requirements in the problem statement.
