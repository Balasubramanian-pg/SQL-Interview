# 1141. User Activity for the Past 30 Days I

## Problem: Daily Active User Count in the Last 30 Days

Write a solution to find the daily active user count for a period of 30 days ending 2019-07-27 inclusively. A user is considered active on a day if they made at least one activity on that day.

Return the result table in any order.

**Tables:**

### 1. `Activity` Table

This table records user activities on a social media website.

| Column Name   | Type    | Description                                                                 |
| ----------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `user_id`       | `int`     | ID of the user performing the activity.                                     |
| `session_id`    | `int`     | ID of the session during which the activity occurred. Each session belongs to exactly one user. |
| `activity_date` | `date`    | Date when the activity occurred.                                            |
| `activity_type` | `enum`    | Type of activity performed, ENUM of ('open\_session', 'end\_session', 'scroll\_down', 'send\_message'). |

**ENUM Values (activity_type):** ('open\_session', 'end\_session', 'scroll\_down', 'send\_message')
**Note:** This table may have duplicate rows.

**Constraints:**

*   Calculate the daily active users (DAU) for the 30-day period ending on '2019-07-27'.
*   A user is considered active on a day if they have at least one activity on that day.
*   Return a table with two columns: `day` (the activity date) and `active_users` (the count of distinct active users for that day).
*   Only include days with at least one active user in the output.
*   The result table can be in any order.

**Example Input:**

**`Activity` Table:**

| user\_id | session\_id | activity\_date | activity\_type |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 1         | 1         | 2019-07-20  | open\_session |
| 1         | 1         | 2019-07-20  | scroll\_down |
| 1         | 1         | 2019-07-20  | end\_session |
| 2         | 4         | 2019-07-20  | open\_session |
| 2         | 4         | 2019-07-21  | send\_message |
| 2         | 4         | 2019-07-21  | end\_session |
| 3         | 2         | 2019-07-21  | open\_session |
| 3         | 2         | 2019-07-21  | send\_message |
| 3         | 2         | 2019-07-21  | end\_session |
| 4         | 3         | 2019-06-25  | open\_session |
| 4         | 3         | 2019-06-25  | end\_session |

**Expected Output:**

| day        | active\_users |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| 2019-07-20  | 2           |
| 2019-07-21  | 2           |

**Explanation of Example Output:**

*   **2019-07-20:** Users with `user_id` 1 and 2 had activities on this day. Active user count is 2.
*   **2019-07-21:** Users with `user_id` 2 and 3 had activities on this day. Active user count is 2.
*   **2019-06-25:** User with `user_id` 4 had activities on this day, but this date is outside the 30-day period ending '2019-07-27'. So it is not considered for the final output.

Days with zero active users within the 30-day period are not included in the output table.

# Solution: Daily Active Users Count (Last 30 Days)

## Approach
To find daily active users for the 30 days ending July 27, 2019:
1. Filter activities within the date range (2019-06-28 to 2019-07-27)
2. Count distinct users per day
3. Exclude days with zero activity

## Solution
```sql
SELECT 
    activity_date AS day,
    COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS active_users
FROM 
    Activity
WHERE 
    activity_date BETWEEN DATE_SUB('2019-07-27', INTERVAL 29 DAY) AND '2019-07-27'
GROUP BY 
    activity_date
HAVING 
    COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) > 0;
```

## Explanation
1. `DATE_SUB('2019-07-27', INTERVAL 29 DAY)` calculates the start date (30 days inclusive)
2. `COUNT(DISTINCT user_id)` ensures each user is counted only once per day
3. `GROUP BY activity_date` creates daily aggregates
4. `HAVING` excludes days with no active users (though redundant with COUNT > 0)

## Alternative Approach
Using explicit date range:
```sql
SELECT 
    activity_date AS day,
    COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS active_users
FROM 
    Activity
WHERE 
    activity_date >= '2019-06-28' 
    AND activity_date <= '2019-07-27'
GROUP BY 
    activity_date;
```

**Key Differences**:
- First solution dynamically calculates date range
- Both correctly handle the 30-day window (inclusive)
- Results are identical for the given problem

**Performance Considerations**:
- An index on activity_date would significantly improve performance
- DISTINCT operation is more costly but necessary for accuracy
- The query only needs to scan 30 days of data with proper indexing
