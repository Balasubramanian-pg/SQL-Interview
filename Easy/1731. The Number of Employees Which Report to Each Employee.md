### Table: Employees

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| employee_id | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| reports_to  | int     |
| age         | int     |

**employee_id** is the column with unique values for this table.  
This table contains information about the employees and the id of the manager they report to.  
Some employees do not report to anyone (reports_to is null).

For this problem, we will consider a manager an employee who has at least 1 other employee reporting to them.

Write a solution to report the ids and the names of all managers, the number of employees who report directly to them, and the average age of the reports rounded to the nearest integer.

Return the result table ordered by employee_id.

### Example 1

#### Input: `Employees` table

| employee_id | name    | reports_to | age |
|-------------|---------|------------|-----|
| 9           | Hercy   | null       | 43  |
| 6           | Alice   | 9          | 41  |
| 4           | Bob     | 9          | 36  |
| 2           | Winston | null       | 37  |

#### Output:

| employee_id | name  | reports_count | average_age |
|-------------|-------|----------------|--------------|
| 9           | Hercy | 2              | 39           |

**Explanation**:  
Hercy has 2 people report directly to him, Alice and Bob.  
Their average age is (41 + 36) / 2 = 38.5, which is 39 after rounding.

### Example 2

#### Input: `Employees` table

| employee_id | name    | reports_to | age |
|-------------|---------|------------|-----|
| 1           | Michael | null       | 45  |
| 2           | Alice   | 1          | 38  |
| 3           | Bob     | 1          | 42  |
| 4           | Charlie | 2          | 34  |
| 5           | David   | 2          | 40  |
| 6           | Eve     | 3          | 37  |
| 7           | Frank   | null       | 50  |
| 8           | Grace   | null       | 48  |

#### Output:

| employee_id | name    | reports_count | average_age |
|-------------|---------|----------------|--------------|
| 1           | Michael | 2              | 40           |
| 2           | Alice   | 2              | 37           |
| 3           | Bob     | 1              | 37           |

### Approach
1. **Identify Managers**: Determine which employees are managers by checking if their `employee_id` appears in the `reports_to` column of other employees.
2. **Group Employees by Manager**: Group the employees by their `reports_to` column to count the number of direct reports and calculate the average age of these reports.
3. **Join with Employee Details**: Join the grouped data with the Employees table to retrieve the names of the managers.
4. **Round Average Age**: Round the average age of the direct reports to the nearest integer.
5. **Order Results**: Sort the results by `employee_id` in ascending order.

### Solution Code
```sql
SELECT 
    e.employee_id, 
    e.name, 
    g.reports_count, 
    ROUND(g.average_age) AS average_age
FROM 
    (SELECT 
        reports_to AS manager_id, 
        COUNT(*) AS reports_count, 
        AVG(age) AS average_age 
     FROM Employees 
     WHERE reports_to IS NOT NULL 
     GROUP BY reports_to) AS g
JOIN 
    Employees e ON g.manager_id = e.employee_id
ORDER BY 
    e.employee_id;
```

### Explanation
1. **Identify Managers**: The subquery groups employees by their `reports_to` column, which gives us the `employee_id` of each manager. This subquery also calculates the count of direct reports and their average age.
2. **Join with Employee Details**: By joining the result of the subquery with the Employees table, we retrieve the names of the managers using their `employee_id`.
3. **Round Average Age**: The `ROUND` function is used to round the average age to the nearest integer.
4. **Order Results**: The final result is ordered by `employee_id` to ensure the output is in ascending order as required.

This approach efficiently groups and aggregates the necessary data, ensuring accurate and optimal results for identifying managers and their reporting metrics.
