# 1407. Top Travellers

### Question: Report Total Distance Travelled by Each User

**Table Schemas:**

**Table: `Users`**

```markdown
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| name          | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
```

*   `id` is the column with unique values for this table.
*   `name` is the name of the user.

**Table: `Rides`**

```markdown
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| user_id       | int     |
| distance      | int     |
+---------------+---------+
```

*   `id` is the column with unique values for this table.
*   `user_id` is the id of the user who traveled the `distance`.

**Problem Statement:**

Write a solution to report the distance traveled by each user.

Return the result table ordered by `travelled_distance` in descending order. If two or more users traveled the same distance, order them by their `name` in ascending order.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

**Input:**

**`Users` table:**

```markdown
+------+-----------+
| id   | name      |
+------+-----------+
| 1    | Alice     |
| 2    | Bob       |
| 3    | Alex      |
| 4    | Donald    |
| 7    | Lee       |
| 13   | Jonathan  |
| 19   | Elvis     |
+------+-----------+
```

**`Rides` table:**

```markdown
+------+----------+----------+
| id   | user_id  | distance |
+------+----------+----------+
| 1    | 1        | 120      |
| 2    | 2        | 317      |
| 3    | 3        | 222      |
| 4    | 7        | 100      |
| 5    | 13       | 312      |
| 6    | 19       | 50       |
| 7    | 7        | 120      |
| 8    | 19       | 400      |
| 9    | 7        | 230      |
+------+----------+----------+
```

**Output:**

```markdown
+----------+--------------------+
| name     | travelled_distance |
+----------+--------------------+
| Elvis    | 450                |
| Lee      | 450                |
| Bob      | 317                |
| Jonathan | 312                |
| Alex     | 222                |
| Alice    | 120                |
| Donald   | 0                  |
+----------+--------------------+
```

**Explanation:**

*   Elvis and Lee traveled 450 miles, Elvis is the top traveler as his name is alphabetically smaller than Lee.
*   Bob, Jonathan, Alex, and Alice have only one ride and we just order them by the total distances of the ride.
*   Donald did not have any rides, the distance traveled by him is 0.
  
# SQL Solution to Report Distance Traveled by Each User

Here's the solution to calculate and report the distance traveled by each user, with the required sorting:

```sql
SELECT 
    u.name,
    COALESCE(SUM(r.distance), 0) AS travelled_distance
FROM 
    Users u
LEFT JOIN 
    Rides r ON u.id = r.user_id
GROUP BY 
    u.id, u.name
ORDER BY 
    travelled_distance DESC,
    u.name ASC;
```

## Explanation:

1. **LEFT JOIN**: We use a LEFT JOIN to include all users from the Users table, even those who haven't taken any rides (like Donald in the example).

2. **COALESCE**: We use COALESCE to convert NULL values (for users with no rides) to 0.

3. **GROUP BY**: We group by both user id and name to ensure we get one row per user.

4. **SUM**: We sum the distance for each user's rides.

5. **ORDER BY**:
   - First by `travelled_distance` in descending order (highest distance first)
   - Then by `name` in ascending order (alphabetical) for users with the same distance

## Key Features:
- Handles users with no rides by showing 0 distance
- Properly aggregates distances for users with multiple rides
- Correctly implements the required sorting logic
- Matches the exact output format shown in the example

The solution efficiently combines the data from both tables and presents it in the requested format, handling all edge cases mentioned in the problem.
