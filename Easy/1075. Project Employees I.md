## Problem: Average Experience Years per Project

Write an SQL query that reports the average experience years of all the employees for each project, rounded to 2 digits.

Return the result table in any order.

**Tables:**

### 1. `Project` Table

This table links projects to employees working on them.

| Column Name | Type    | Description                                                                 |
| ----------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `project_id`  | `int`     | Primary key (part 1), unique identifier for each project.                   |
| `employee_id` | `int`     | Primary key (part 2), foreign key referencing `employee_id` in `Employee` table. |

**Primary Key:** (`project_id`, `employee_id`)
**Foreign Key:** `employee_id` references `Employee.employee_id`

### 2. `Employee` Table

This table contains information about employees, including their experience.

| Column Name      | Type    | Description                                                                 |
| ----------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `employee_id`      | `int`     | Primary key, unique identifier for each employee.                           |
| `name`             | `varchar` | Name of the employee.                                                     |
| `experience_years` | `int`     | Number of years of experience the employee has. Guaranteed to be not `NULL`. |

**Primary Key:** `employee_id`

**Constraints:**

*   Calculate the average `experience_years` for employees working on each project.
*   Round the average experience years to 2 decimal places.
*   Return the `project_id` and the calculated `average_years` for each project.
*   The result table can be in any order.

**Example Input:**

**`Project` Table:**

| project\_id | employee\_id |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 1         | 1         |
| 1         | 2         |
| 1         | 3         |
| 2         | 1         |
| 2         | 4         |

**`Employee` Table:**

| employee\_id | name   | experience\_years |
| ----------- | ------ | ----------------- |
| 1         | Khaled | 3               |
| 2         | Ali    | 2               |
| 3         | John   | 1               |
| 4         | Doe    | 2               |

**Expected Output:**

| project\_id | average\_years |
| ----------- | --------------- |
| 1         | 2.00            |
| 2         | 2.50            |

**Explanation of Example Output:**

*   **Project 1 (project\_id=1):** Employees working on this project are:
    *   Employee 1 (Khaled) with 3 years of experience.
    *   Employee 2 (Ali) with 2 years of experience.
    *   Employee 3 (John) with 1 year of experience.
    Average experience years for Project 1: (3 + 2 + 1) / 3 = 2.00
*   **Project 2 (project\_id=2):** Employees working on this project are:
    *   Employee 1 (Khaled) with 3 years of experience.
    *   Employee 4 (Doe) with 2 years of experience.
    Average experience years for Project 2: (3 + 2) / 2 = 2.50

The output table shows `project_id` and their corresponding `average_years`, rounded to two decimal places.

# Solution: Average Employee Experience per Project

## Approach
To calculate the average experience years for each project:
1. Join the Project and Employee tables to associate employees with their projects
2. Group the results by project_id
3. Calculate the average experience years for each group
4. Round the result to 2 decimal places

## Solution
```sql
SELECT 
    p.project_id,
    ROUND(AVG(e.experience_years), 2) AS average_years
FROM 
    Project p
JOIN 
    Employee e ON p.employee_id = e.employee_id
GROUP BY 
    p.project_id;
```

## Explanation
1. We join the Project and Employee tables using employee_id as the key
2. The GROUP BY clause groups the results by project_id
3. AVG() calculates the average experience years for each project
4. ROUND(..., 2) ensures the result has exactly 2 decimal places
5. The output shows each project_id with its corresponding average experience years

## Alternative Approach
Using a subquery for calculation:
```sql
SELECT 
    project_id,
    ROUND(
        (SELECT AVG(experience_years)
         FROM Employee
         WHERE employee_id IN (
             SELECT employee_id
             FROM Project
             WHERE Project.project_id = p.project_id
         )),
        2
    ) AS average_years
FROM 
    (SELECT DISTINCT project_id FROM Project) p;
```

**Key Differences**:
- The first solution is more straightforward and efficient
- The subquery version might be useful in more complex scenarios
- Both solutions produce identical results

**Performance Considerations**:
- The JOIN version is typically more efficient
- An index on employee_id in both tables would optimize performance
- The GROUP BY operation is the most computationally intensive part
