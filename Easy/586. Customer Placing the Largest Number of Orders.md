# 586. Customer Placing the Largest Number of Orders

#### Problem: Customer Placing the Largest Number of Orders

Find the `customer_number` for the customer who has placed the largest number of orders. It is guaranteed that exactly one customer will have placed more orders than any other customer in the test cases.

**Tables:**

### 1. `Orders` Table

This table contains information about orders and the customers who placed them.

| Column Name     | Type     | Description                                         |
| --------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `order_number`    | `int`      | Primary key, unique identifier for each order.      |
| `customer_number` | `int`      | ID of the customer who placed the order.            |

**Primary Key:** `order_number`

**Constraints:**

*   Identify the customer who has the highest count of orders in the `Orders` table.
*   There will be exactly one customer with the maximum number of orders.
*   Return only the `customer_number` of this customer.

**Example Input:**

**`Orders` Table:**

| order\_number | customer\_number |
| ------------- | --------------- |
| 1           | 1               |
| 2           | 2               |
| 3           | 3               |
| 4           | 3               |

**Expected Output:**

| customer\_number |
| --------------- |
| 3               |

**Explanation of Example Output:**

*   **Customer 1:** Placed 1 order (order\_number 1).
*   **Customer 2:** Placed 1 order (order\_number 2).
*   **Customer 3:** Placed 2 orders (order\_number 3 and 4).

Customer 3 has placed the largest number of orders (2), which is more than any other customer. Therefore, the output is `customer_number` 3.

**Follow-up:**

What if more than one customer has the largest number of orders? Can you find all the `customer_number` values in this case?

## Basic Solution (Single Top Customer)

```sql
SELECT customer_number
FROM Orders
GROUP BY customer_number
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

### Explanation:
1. `GROUP BY customer_number` - Groups all orders by customer
2. `COUNT(*)` - Counts orders per customer
3. `ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC` - Sorts customers by order count (highest first)
4. `LIMIT 1` - Takes only the top customer

## Follow-up Solution (Handling Ties)

If multiple customers could tie for the most orders:

```sql
WITH OrderCounts AS (
    SELECT 
        customer_number, 
        COUNT(*) AS order_count
    FROM Orders
    GROUP BY customer_number
)
SELECT customer_number
FROM OrderCounts
WHERE order_count = (SELECT MAX(order_count) FROM OrderCounts);
```

### Explanation:
1. First CTE counts orders per customer
2. Then we select all customers whose order count matches the maximum count
3. This handles cases where multiple customers tie for most orders

## Example Walkthrough

Using the sample data:
- Customer 1: 1 order
- Customer 2: 1 order
- Customer 3: 2 orders

The query correctly returns customer 3 as they have the most orders (2).

For the follow-up, if we had:
- Customer 4 with 2 orders
The second query would return both customers 3 and 4.
