# 586. Customer Placing the Largest Number of Orders

#### Problem: Customer Placing the Largest Number of Orders

Find the `customer_number` for the customer who has placed the largest number of orders. It is guaranteed that exactly one customer will have placed more orders than any other customer in the test cases.

**Tables:**

### 1. `Orders` Table

This table contains information about orders and the customers who placed them.

| Column Name     | Type     | Description                                         |
| --------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `order_number`    | `int`      | Primary key, unique identifier for each order.      |
| `customer_number` | `int`      | ID of the customer who placed the order.            |

**Primary Key:** `order_number`

**Constraints:**

*   Identify the customer who has the highest count of orders in the `Orders` table.
*   There will be exactly one customer with the maximum number of orders.
*   Return only the `customer_number` of this customer.

**Example Input:**

**`Orders` Table:**

| order\_number | customer\_number |
| ------------- | --------------- |
| 1           | 1               |
| 2           | 2               |
| 3           | 3               |
| 4           | 3               |

**Expected Output:**

| customer\_number |
| --------------- |
| 3               |

**Explanation of Example Output:**

*   **Customer 1:** Placed 1 order (order\_number 1).
*   **Customer 2:** Placed 1 order (order\_number 2).
*   **Customer 3:** Placed 2 orders (order\_number 3 and 4).

Customer 3 has placed the largest number of orders (2), which is more than any other customer. Therefore, the output is `customer_number` 3.

**Follow-up:**

What if more than one customer has the largest number of orders? Can you find all the `customer_number` values in this case?
