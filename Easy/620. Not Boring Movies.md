## Problem: Movies with Odd IDs and Non-Boring Descriptions

Write a solution to report the movies from the `Cinema` table that have an odd-numbered `id` and a `description` that is not "boring".

Return the result table ordered by `rating` in descending order.

**Tables:**

### 1. `Cinema` Table

This table contains information about movies.

| Column Name    | Type     | Description                                                                 |
| ----------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`             | `int`      | Primary key, unique identifier for each movie.                              |
| `movie`          | `varchar`  | Name of the movie.                                                          |
| `description`    | `varchar`  | Description or genre of the movie.                                        |
| `rating`         | `float`    | Rating of the movie, a float with 2 decimal places in the range [0, 10]. |

**Primary Key:** `id`

**Constraints:**

*   Select movies where the `id` is an odd number.
*   Select movies where the `description` is not equal to "boring".
*   Return the `id`, `movie`, `description`, and `rating` for the selected movies.
*   Order the result table by `rating` in descending order (highest rating first).

**Example Input:**

**`Cinema` Table:**

| id  | movie      | description | rating |
| --- | ---------- | ----------- | ------ |
| 1   | War        | great 3D    | 8.9    |
| 2   | Science    | fiction     | 8.5    |
| 3   | irish      | boring      | 6.2    |
| 4   | Ice song   | Fantacy     | 8.6    |
| 5   | House card | Interesting | 9.1    |

**Expected Output:**

| id  | movie      | description | rating |
| --- | ---------- | ----------- | ------ |
| 5   | House card | Interesting | 9.1    |
| 1   | War        | great 3D    | 8.9    |

**Explanation of Example Output:**

*   **Movie with id=1 ("War"):**  `id` is odd, `description` is "great 3D" (not "boring"). Included.
*   **Movie with id=2 ("Science"):** `id` is even. Excluded.
*   **Movie with id=3 ("irish"):** `id` is odd, but `description` is "boring". Excluded.
*   **Movie with id=4 ("Ice song"):** `id` is even. Excluded.
*   **Movie with id=5 ("House card"):** `id` is odd, `description` is "Interesting" (not "boring"). Included.

The selected movies are "House card" and "War". They are ordered by `rating` in descending order: "House card" (9.1) and then "War" (8.9).

##### Solution: Non-Boring Odd-ID Movies

## Procedural Decomposition

1. **Filter Odd IDs**: Select only movies with odd-numbered IDs (id % 2 = 1)
2. **Exclude Boring Movies**: Remove movies with "boring" in the description (case-sensitive)
3. **Sort by Rating**: Order the remaining movies by rating in descending order
4. **Return All Columns**: Include all original columns in the result

## Approach

1. **Use MOD Function**: Identify odd-numbered IDs using MOD(id, 2) = 1 or id % 2 = 1
2. **String Comparison**: Filter out "boring" descriptions with <> or != operator
3. **Sorting**: Apply ORDER BY rating DESC for the required output sequence
4. **Complete Selection**: Return all columns from the filtered and sorted results

## Solution

```sql
SELECT id, movie, description, rating
FROM Cinema
WHERE id % 2 = 1 AND description != 'boring'
ORDER BY rating DESC;
```

**Explanation**:
- `id % 2 = 1` selects only odd-numbered IDs
- `description != 'boring'` excludes movies with boring descriptions
- `ORDER BY rating DESC` sorts results from highest to lowest rating
- All columns are returned in the original table structure

## Alternative Approaches

### Using MOD Function Explicitly

```sql
SELECT id, movie, description, rating
FROM Cinema
WHERE MOD(id, 2) = 1 AND description <> 'boring'
ORDER BY rating DESC;
```

### Using NOT Operator for Clarity

```sql
SELECT id, movie, description, rating
FROM Cinema
WHERE id % 2 != 0 AND NOT description = 'boring'
ORDER BY rating DESC;
```

**Key Differences**:
- All versions produce identical results
- The MOD function is more explicit but functionally equivalent to %
- The NOT operator version might be more readable for some

**Performance Considerations**:
- All solutions will perform similarly as they use the same filtering logic
- An index on the id column would help with the odd-numbered ID filter
- The description filter is case-sensitive by default in most SQL implementations
