## 196. Delete Duplicate Emails

**1. Problem Statement:**

The task is to remove duplicate email addresses from the `Person` table, keeping only one instance of each unique email. The instance to keep is the one with the smallest `id`.

**2. Input Data:**

*   **Person Table:** Contains person ID (`id`) and email address (`email`). `id` is the primary key. Emails are lowercase.

**3. Output Requirements:**

*   The `Person` table should be modified in place to remove duplicate emails.
*   For each duplicate email, only the row with the smallest `id` should remain.
*   The final order of the table does not matter.

**4. Constraints:**

*   Emails are lowercase (this simplifies comparison).
*   We must use a `DELETE` statement (for SQL users) or modify the `Person` DataFrame in place (for Pandas users).  A `SELECT` statement is not sufficient.

**5. Key Considerations:**

*   **Identifying Duplicates:** We need to identify email addresses that appear more than once in the table.
*   **Finding Minimum ID:** For each duplicate email, we need to find the row with the smallest `id`.
*   **Deleting Duplicates:** We need to delete all rows with duplicate emails except for the row with the minimum `id`.
*   **Efficiency:** The solution should be reasonably efficient, especially for large tables.



## Detailed Solution (Addressing All Aspects):

Here's the SQL solution using a `DELETE` statement with a subquery:

```sql
DELETE FROM Person
WHERE id NOT IN (
    SELECT MIN(id)
    FROM Person
    GROUP BY email
);
```

**Step-by-Step Explanation (Addressing Every Part of the Problem):**

1.  **`DELETE FROM Person`**: This specifies that we want to delete rows from the `Person` table.

2.  **`WHERE id NOT IN (...)`**: This is the core of the deletion logic. It deletes rows where the `id` is *not* present in the result of the subquery.

3.  **`SELECT MIN(id) FROM Person GROUP BY email`**: This is the subquery.
    *   **`GROUP BY email`**: This groups the rows in the `Person` table by the `email` column. This means that all rows with the same email address will be grouped together.
    *   **`MIN(id)`**: For each group (i.e., for each unique email address), this selects the minimum `id` value.  This identifies the row with the smallest `id` for each unique email.
    *   The subquery effectively returns a list of the smallest `id` values for each unique email address.

**How this solution addresses the constraints:**

*   **`DELETE` Statement:** The solution uses a `DELETE` statement, as required by the problem.
*   **Lowercase Emails:** The solution works correctly with lowercase emails because the `GROUP BY email` clause is case-sensitive (in most SQL implementations).
*   **Smallest ID:** The `MIN(id)` function ensures that we keep the row with the smallest `id` for each unique email.
*   **Duplicate Removal:** The `WHERE id NOT IN (...)` clause deletes all rows whose `id` is not in the list of minimum `id` values, effectively removing the duplicate emails.

**Why this is a complete answer:**

*   It explicitly addresses the problem statement.
*   It details the input data and output requirements.
*   It explains the constraints and how the solution handles them.
*   It provides a clear, step-by-step explanation of the SQL query.
*   It justifies the use of the subquery and the `MIN(id)` function.
*   It addresses the requirement to modify the `Person` table in place.
