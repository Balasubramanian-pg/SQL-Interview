## 511. Game Play Analysis I

Find the first login date for each player from the `Activity` table. The first login date is the earliest `event_date` recorded for each `player_id`.

**Tables:**

### 1. `Activity` Table

This table records the activity of players in a game.

| Column Name  | Type    | Description                                                                                             |
| ----------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `player_id`    | `int`     | Primary key (part 1), unique identifier for each player.                                                  |
| `device_id`    | `int`     | The ID of the device used by the player for the activity.                                                |
| `event_date`   | `date`    | Primary key (part 2), the date when the player logged in and played games.                                |
| `games_played` | `int`     | The number of games played by the player on the `event_date` using the `device_id`. Can be 0 if they just logged in. |

**Primary Key:** (`player_id`, `event_date`)

**Constraints:**

*   The `Activity` table contains records of player activity, including login dates and games played.
*   We need to determine the earliest `event_date` for each unique `player_id`.

**Example Input:**

**`Activity` Table:**

| player\_id | device\_id | event\_date | games\_played |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-01  | 5           |
| 1         | 2         | 2016-05-02  | 6           |
| 2         | 3         | 2017-06-25  | 1           |
| 3         | 1         | 2016-03-02  | 0           |
| 3         | 4         | 2018-07-03  | 5           |

**Expected Output:**

| player\_id | first\_login |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| 1         | 2016-03-01  |
| 2         | 2017-06-25  |
| 3         | 2016-03-02  |

**Explanation of Example Output:**

*   **Player 1:** Has activity on '2016-03-01' and '2016-05-02'. The earliest date is '2016-03-01'.
*   **Player 2:** Has only one activity record on '2017-06-25'. This is their first login date.
*   **Player 3:** Has activity on '2016-03-02' and '2018-07-03'. The earliest date is '2016-03-02'.
