## 511. Game Play Analysis I

Find the first login date for each player from the `Activity` table. The first login date is the earliest `event_date` recorded for each `player_id`.

**Tables:**

### 1. `Activity` Table

This table records the activity of players in a game.

| Column Name  | Type    | Description                                                                                             |
| ----------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `player_id`    | `int`     | Primary key (part 1), unique identifier for each player.                                                  |
| `device_id`    | `int`     | The ID of the device used by the player for the activity.                                                |
| `event_date`   | `date`    | Primary key (part 2), the date when the player logged in and played games.                                |
| `games_played` | `int`     | The number of games played by the player on the `event_date` using the `device_id`. Can be 0 if they just logged in. |

**Primary Key:** (`player_id`, `event_date`)

**Constraints:**

*   The `Activity` table contains records of player activity, including login dates and games played.
*   We need to determine the earliest `event_date` for each unique `player_id`.

**Example Input:**

**`Activity` Table:**

| player\_id | device\_id | event\_date | games\_played |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-01  | 5           |
| 1         | 2         | 2016-05-02  | 6           |
| 2         | 3         | 2017-06-25  | 1           |
| 3         | 1         | 2016-03-02  | 0           |
| 3         | 4         | 2018-07-03  | 5           |

**Expected Output:**

| player\_id | first\_login |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| 1         | 2016-03-01  |
| 2         | 2017-06-25  |
| 3         | 2016-03-02  |

**Explanation of Example Output:**

*   **Player 1:** Has activity on '2016-03-01' and '2016-05-02'. The earliest date is '2016-03-01'.
*   **Player 2:** Has only one activity record on '2017-06-25'. This is their first login date.
*   **Player 3:** Has activity on '2016-03-02' and '2018-07-03'. The earliest date is '2016-03-02'.

## Understanding the Problem

We need to find the earliest login date (`event_date`) for each player (`player_id`) from the Activity table. The result should show each player's ID and their first login date.

## Solution

```sql
SELECT 
    player_id,
    MIN(event_date) AS first_login
FROM 
    Activity
GROUP BY 
    player_id;
```

## Explanation

1. **SELECT Clause**:
   - `player_id`: Identifies each unique player
   - `MIN(event_date) AS first_login`: Finds the earliest date for each player and names the column "first_login"

2. **FROM Clause**:
   - Specifies we're querying from the Activity table

3. **GROUP BY Clause**:
   - Groups the results by `player_id` so we get one row per player
   - The `MIN(event_date)` function then operates within each group to find the earliest date

## Alternative Approach (Using Window Functions)

For databases that support window functions (like MySQL 8.0+, PostgreSQL, SQL Server), you could also use:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT
    player_id,
    FIRST_VALUE(event_date) OVER (PARTITION BY player_id ORDER BY event_date) AS first_login
FROM 
    Activity;
```

However, the first solution using `MIN()` with `GROUP BY` is more widely supported across different SQL database systems and is typically more efficient for this specific requirement.
