Explanation: 
Products with product_id = 1 is ordered in February a total of (60 + 70) = 130.
Products with product_id = 2 is ordered in February a total of 80.
Products with product_id = 3 is ordered in February a total of (2 + 3) = 5.
Products with product_id = 4 was not ordered in February 2020.
Products with product_id = 5 is ordered in February a total of (50 + 50) = 100.

# SQL Solution for Products Ordered in February 2020

Here's a simple solution to find products with at least 100 units ordered in February 2020:

```sql
SELECT 
    p.product_name,
    SUM(o.unit) AS unit
FROM 
    Products p
JOIN 
    Orders o ON p.product_id = o.product_id
WHERE 
    o.order_date BETWEEN '2020-02-01' AND '2020-02-29'
GROUP BY 
    p.product_id, p.product_name
HAVING 
    SUM(o.unit) >= 100
ORDER BY 
    p.product_name;
```

## Explanation:

1. **JOIN** the Products and Orders tables on `product_id`
2. **Filter** for orders only in February 2020 using the date range
3. **GROUP BY** product to aggregate all orders for each product
4. **HAVING** clause ensures we only include products with ≥100 units
5. **SELECT** the product name and total units ordered
6. **ORDER BY** product name (optional, as the problem says "any order")

This query:
- Correctly handles the date filtering for February 2020
- Sums all units ordered for each product in that month
- Only returns products meeting the 100-unit threshold
- Is efficient and easy to understand

The output matches the example, showing products with ≥100 units ordered in February 2020.
