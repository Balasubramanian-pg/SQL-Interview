**Explanation of Example Output:**

*   **John (sales\_id=1):** Has orders for company "RED" (order\_id 3). Excluded.

Below is the solution formatted according to your requirements:

---

### **1. Procedural Decomposition of the Solution**

1. **Identify the Target Company**: Determine the `com_id` of the company named "RED" from the `Company` table.
2. **Find Salespersons with Orders for "RED"**: Identify all `sales_id` values from the `Orders` table that are associated with the `com_id` of "RED".
3. **Exclude These Salespersons**: Retrieve all salespersons from the `SalesPerson` table whose `sales_id` is **not** in the list obtained in step 2.
4. **Return Results**: Output the names of the salespersons who meet the criteria.

---

### **2. Approach**

The approach involves:
- Using a subquery to find all `sales_id` values associated with orders for the company "RED".
- Excluding these `sales_id` values from the `SalesPerson` table to identify salespersons who have not placed any orders for "RED".
- Selecting only the `name` column of the qualifying salespersons.

---

### **3. Solution**

```sql
SELECT s.name
FROM SalesPerson s
WHERE s.sales_id NOT IN (
    SELECT o.sales_id
    FROM Orders o
    JOIN Company c ON o.com_id = c.com_id
    WHERE c.name = 'RED'
);
```

**Explanation:**
- The subquery identifies all `sales_id` values from the `Orders` table where the associated company is "RED".
- The outer query selects salespersons whose `sales_id` is **not** in the list generated by the subquery, ensuring they have not placed any orders for "RED".
- Only the `name` column is returned for the qualifying salespersons.

---

### **4. Alternative Approach**

An alternative approach uses a `LEFT JOIN` and filters for `NULL` values to achieve the same result:

```sql
SELECT s.name
FROM SalesPerson s
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT DISTINCT o.sales_id
    FROM Orders o
    JOIN Company c ON o.com_id = c.com_id
    WHERE c.name = 'RED'
) red_orders ON s.sales_id = red_orders.sales_id
WHERE red_orders.sales_id IS NULL;
```

**Explanation:**
- The subquery identifies all distinct `sales_id` values associated with orders for "RED".
- A `LEFT JOIN` is performed between the `SalesPerson` table and the subquery result.
- The `WHERE` clause filters for rows where there is no match (`NULL`) in the subquery result, indicating the salesperson has not placed any orders for "RED".

Both approaches are efficient and yield the same result. The choice depends on personal preference or specific database optimization considerations.
