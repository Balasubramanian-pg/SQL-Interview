Here's the complete structured response including the table and all details:

### Problem Statement

**Table: Weather**

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| id          | int     |
| recordDate  | date    |
| temperature | int     |

- `id` is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
- There are no two rows with the same `recordDate`.
- This table contains daily temperature records.

**Task**:  
Find all dates' `id` where the temperature was higher than the previous day's temperature. Return the result in any order.

**Example Input**:

| id | recordDate | temperature |
|----|------------|-------------|
| 1  | 2015-01-01 | 10          |
| 2  | 2015-01-02 | 25          |
| 3  | 2015-01-03 | 20          |
| 4  | 2015-01-04 | 30          |

**Expected Output**:

| id |
|----|
| 2  |
| 4  |

**Explanation**:
- On 2015-01-02, temperature increased from 10 → 25 (higher than previous day)
- On 2015-01-04, temperature increased from 20 → 30 (higher than previous day)

### Approaches

1. **Self-Join Method**:
   - Join the table with itself to compare each day with its previous day
   - Use `DATEDIFF()` to ensure we're comparing consecutive days
   - Filter rows where current temperature > previous temperature

2. **Window Function Method**:
   - Use `LAG()` to access the previous day's temperature
   - Compare directly with current temperature

### Solution Code

**Option 1: Self-Join**
```sql
SELECT w1.id
FROM Weather w1
JOIN Weather w2 ON DATEDIFF(w1.recordDate, w2.recordDate) = 1
WHERE w1.temperature > w2.temperature;
```

**Option 2: Window Function (More Modern Approach)**
```sql
WITH TempComparison AS (
    SELECT 
        id,
        temperature,
        LAG(temperature) OVER (ORDER BY recordDate) AS prev_temp
    FROM Weather
)
SELECT id
FROM TempComparison
WHERE temperature > prev_temp;
```

### Explanation

**Self-Join**:
- Creates two instances of the Weather table (`w1` and `w2`)
- Joins rows where `w1.recordDate` is exactly 1 day after `w2.recordDate`
- Returns `w1.id` where `w1.temperature > w2.temperature`

**Window Function**:
- Creates a CTE that adds a `prev_temp` column showing the previous day's temperature
- Uses `LAG()` to look back exactly 1 row (ordered by date)
- Filters rows where current temperature > previous temperature

Both solutions correctly identify days where temperatures increased from the previous day. The window function approach is generally more efficient for large datasets.
