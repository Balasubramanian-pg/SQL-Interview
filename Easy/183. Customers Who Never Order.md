# **183. Customers Who Never Order**

You are given two tables:

**Customers**

| id | name  |
|----|-------|
| 1  | Joe   |
| 2  | Henry |
| 3  | Sam   |
| 4  | Max   |

**Orders**

| id | customerId |
|----|------------|
| 1  | 3          |
| 2  | 1          |

You need to find customers who **never placed any order**.

### **Approach**

The idea is to compare the list of all customers with the list of customers who have placed orders. Those customers who are **not present in the Orders table** are the ones who never placed an order.

To solve this, we use a `LEFT JOIN`. A `LEFT JOIN` returns all records from the left table (Customers), and the matched records from the right table (Orders). If there's no match, the result from the right table will be `NULL`.

So if we join Customers to Orders using `LEFT JOIN`, and then filter where `Orders.customerId IS NULL`, weâ€™ll get customers who have no corresponding entry in the Orders table.

### **SQL Query**

```sql
SELECT c.name AS Customers
FROM Customers c
LEFT JOIN Orders o
  ON c.id = o.customerId
WHERE o.customerId IS NULL;
```

### **Step-by-Step Explanation**

1. **LEFT JOIN Customers and Orders** on `Customers.id = Orders.customerId`.

   This gives all customers, along with their order info if any.

2. **Filter out** rows where `Orders.customerId IS NULL`.

   These are the customers who never placed an order.

3. **Select only the name** column and return it as `Customers`.
