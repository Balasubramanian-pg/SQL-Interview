## Question: Show Unique ID for Each Employee (or Null if Missing)

**Table Schemas:**

**Table: `Employees`**

```markdown
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| name          | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
```

*   `id` is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
*   Each row of this table contains the `id` and the `name` of an employee in a company.

**Table: `EmployeeUNI`**

```markdown
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| unique_id     | int     |
+---------------+---------+
```

*   `(id, unique_id)` is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
*   Each row of this table contains the `id` and the corresponding `unique_id` of an employee in the company.

**Problem Statement:**

Write a solution to show the unique ID of each user. If a user does not have a unique ID, show `null`.

Return the result table in any order.

**Example 1:**

**Input:**

**`Employees` table:**

```markdown
+----+----------+
| id | name     |
+----+----------+
| 1  | Alice    |
| 7  | Bob      |
| 11 | Meir     |
| 90 | Winston  |
| 3  | Jonathan |
+----+----------+
```

**`EmployeeUNI` table:**

```markdown
+----+-----------+
| id | unique_id |
+----+-----------+
| 3  | 1         |
| 11 | 2         |
| 90 | 3         |
+----+-----------+
```

**Output:**

```markdown
+-----------+----------+
| unique_id | name     |
+-----------+----------+
| null      | Alice    |
| null      | Bob      |
| 2         | Meir     |
| 3         | Winston  |
| 1         | Jonathan |
+-----------+----------+
```

**Explanation:**

*   Alice and Bob do not have a unique ID, so we show `null` instead.
*   The unique ID of Meir is 2.
*   The unique ID of Winston is 3.
*   The unique ID of Jonathan is 1.

# SQL Solution to Show Employee Unique IDs

Here's a simple solution using a LEFT JOIN to display all employees with their unique IDs (or NULL if they don't have one):

```sql
SELECT 
    euni.unique_id,
    e.name
FROM 
    Employees e
LEFT JOIN 
    EmployeeUNI euni ON e.id = euni.id
ORDER BY 
    e.name;
```

## Explanation:

1. We use a `LEFT JOIN` to include all employees from the `Employees` table, regardless of whether they have a matching record in `EmployeeUNI`.

2. The join condition `e.id = euni.id` matches employees with their unique IDs when available.

3. For employees without a unique ID (like Alice and Bob in the example), the `unique_id` column will automatically show as NULL.

4. The `ORDER BY e.name` sorts the results alphabetically by employee name (this is optional as the problem allows any order).

This solution:
- Correctly handles cases where employees don't have unique IDs
- Preserves all employees from the original table
- Shows NULL for missing unique IDs as required
- Is simple and efficient with just one join operation

The output matches the example format exactly, showing all employees with their unique IDs or NULL where appropriate.
