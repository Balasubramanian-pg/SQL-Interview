## 596. Classes More Than 5 Students

Find all the classes that have at least five students enrolled in them.

**Tables:**

### 1. `Courses` Table

This table contains information about students and the classes they are enrolled in.

| Column Name | Type    | Description                                                                 |
| ----------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `student`     | `varchar` | Primary key (part 1), name of the student.                                  |
| `class`       | `varchar` | Primary key (part 2), name of the class the student is enrolled in.        |

**Primary Key:** (`student`, `class`)

**Constraints:**

*   Identify classes that have 5 or more students enrolled.
*   Return only the names of these classes.
*   The result table can be in any order.

**Example Input:**

**`Courses` Table:**

| student | class    |
| ------- | -------- |
| A       | Math     |
| B       | English  |
| C       | Math     |
| D       | Biology  |
| E       | Math     |
| F       | Computer |
| G       | Math     |
| H       | Math     |
| I       | Math     |

**Expected Output:**

| class   |
| -------- |
| Math    |

**Explanation of Example Output:**

*   **Math:** Students enrolled: A, C, E, G, H, I (6 students). Since 6 is at least 5, Math is included.
*   **English:** Students enrolled: B (1 student). Since 1 is less than 5, English is excluded.
*   **Biology:** Students enrolled: D (1 student). Since 1 is less than 5, Biology is excluded.
*   **Computer:** Students enrolled: F (1 student). Since 1 is less than 5, Computer is excluded.

Therefore, only Math is identified as a class with at least five students.

## Understanding the Problem

We need to identify classes that have at least 5 students enrolled. Each student-class combination is unique (as indicated by the primary key).

## Solution

```sql
SELECT class
FROM Courses
GROUP BY class
HAVING COUNT(student) >= 5;
```

## Explanation

1. **Grouping by Class**:
   - `GROUP BY class` organizes all records by their class name

2. **Counting Students**:
   - `COUNT(student)` calculates how many students are in each class group

3. **Filtering for Popular Classes**:
   - `HAVING COUNT(student) >= 5` only keeps classes with 5 or more students

4. **Result**:
   - Returns just the class names that meet the criteria

## Example Walkthrough

Using the sample data:
- Math: 6 students (A, C, E, G, H, I) → included
- English: 1 student (B) → excluded
- Biology: 1 student (D) → excluded
- Computer: 1 student (F) → excluded

The query correctly returns only "Math" as it's the only class with ≥5 students.

## Alternative Solution (Using Subquery)

For some database systems, you might see:

```sql
SELECT class
FROM (
    SELECT class, COUNT(*) as student_count
    FROM Courses
    GROUP BY class
) AS class_counts
WHERE student_count >= 5;
```

This produces the same result but is less concise than the HAVING clause approach.
