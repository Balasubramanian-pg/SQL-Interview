To solve this problem, we need to determine the primary department for each employee based on their department entries and the primary flag. The primary department is defined as the department with the primary flag set to 'Y' if the employee is in multiple departments, or the only department if the employee is in a single department.

### Approach
1. **Identify Primary Departments with 'Y' Flag**: Select all employees who have a department marked as primary (primary_flag = 'Y'). These employees are part of multiple departments, and their primary department is explicitly marked.
2. **Identify Single Department Employees**: Select all employees who belong to only one department. These employees might not have a primary flag set to 'Y', but their only department is considered their primary department regardless of the flag.

By combining these two sets of results using a UNION, we ensure that all employees are correctly categorized into their primary departments.

### Solution Code
```sql
SELECT employee_id, department_id
FROM Employee
WHERE primary_flag = 'Y'
UNION
SELECT employee_id, department_id
FROM Employee
WHERE employee_id IN (
    SELECT employee_id
    FROM Employee
    GROUP BY employee_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) = 1
);
```

### Explanation
1. **Primary Flag Check**: The first part of the UNION selects all departments where the primary flag is 'Y'. This captures employees with multiple departments, ensuring their explicitly marked primary department is chosen.
2. **Single Department Check**: The second part of the UNION selects employees who are in exactly one department. This is determined by grouping employees and counting their entries, selecting those with a count of 1. This ensures their only department is chosen as the primary, regardless of the flag.

This approach efficiently combines both conditions using a UNION, ensuring that all employees are correctly mapped to their primary departments based on the problem's criteria.
