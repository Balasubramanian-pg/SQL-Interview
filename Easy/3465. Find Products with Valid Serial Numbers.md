# 3465. Find Products with Valid Serial Numbers

## Problem Statement

The goal is to find all products whose description contains a valid serial number pattern. A valid serial number follows these rules:

1. It starts with the letters `SN` (case-sensitive).
2. Followed by exactly 4 digits.
3. It must have a hyphen (`-`) followed by exactly 4 digits.
4. The serial number must be within the description (it may not necessarily start at the beginning).

The result should be a table ordered by `product_id` in ascending order.

## Example

### Input

**Products Table:**

| product_id | product_name | description                                          |
|------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 1          | Widget A     | This is a sample product with SN1234-5678            |
| 2          | Widget B     | A product with serial SN9876-1234 in the description |
| 3          | Widget C     | Product SN1234-56789 is available now                |
| 4          | Widget D     | No serial number here                                |
| 5          | Widget E     | Check out SN4321-8765 in this description            |

### Output

| product_id | product_name | description                                          |
|------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 1          | Widget A     | This is a sample product with SN1234-5678            |
| 2          | Widget B     | A product with serial SN9876-1234 in the description |
| 5          | Widget E     | Check out SN4321-8765 in this description            |

## Explanation

- **Product 1:** Valid serial number `SN1234-5678`
- **Product 2:** Valid serial number `SN9876-1234`
- **Product 3:** Invalid serial number `SN1234-56789` (contains 5 digits after the hyphen)
- **Product 4:** No serial number in the description
- **Product 5:** Valid serial number `SN4321-8765`

## Solution

### SQL Query

```sql
SELECT
    product_id,
    product_name,
    description
FROM
    products
WHERE
    description REGEXP 'SN[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{4}'
ORDER BY
    product_id ASC;
```

### Explanation

- **REGEXP 'SN[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{4}':** This regular expression checks for the pattern `SN` followed by exactly 4 digits, a hyphen, and then exactly 4 more digits.
- The query filters the products based on this pattern and orders the results by `product_id` in ascending order.

This solution efficiently identifies products with valid serial numbers in their descriptions.
