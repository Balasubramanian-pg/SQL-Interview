## Problem: Product Sales Information

Write a solution to report the `product_name`, `year`, and `price` for each `sale_id` in the `Sales` table.

Return the resulting table in any order.

**Tables:**

### 1. `Sales` Table

This table contains sales information for products.

| Column Name | Type  | Description                                                                 |
| ----------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sale_id`     | `int`   | Primary key (part 1), unique identifier for each sale.                      |
| `product_id`  | `int`   | Foreign key, identifier of the product sold, references `Product.product_id`. |
| `year`        | `int`   | Primary key (part 2), year of the sale.                                    |
| `quantity`    | `int`   | Quantity of the product sold in the sale.                                   |
| `price`       | `int`   | Price per unit of the product in the sale.                                  |

**Primary Key:** (`sale_id`, `year`)
**Foreign Key:** `product_id` references `Product.product_id`

### 2. `Product` Table

This table contains information about products.

| Column Name  | Type    | Description                                                                 |
| ----------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `product_id`   | `int`     | Primary key, unique identifier for each product.                            |
| `product_name` | `varchar` | Name of the product.                                                        |

**Primary Key:** `product_id`

**Constraints:**

*   Join the `Sales` and `Product` tables using `product_id`.
*   For each `sale_id` in the `Sales` table, retrieve the corresponding `product_name` from the `Product` table.
*   Include the `year` and `price` from the `Sales` table in the output.
*   Return the result table in any order.

**Example Input:**

**`Sales` Table:**

| sale\_id | product\_id | year | quantity | price |
| ------- | ----------- | ---- | -------- | ----- |
| 1     | 100         | 2008 | 10       | 5000  |
| 2     | 100         | 2009 | 12       | 5000  |
| 7     | 200         | 2011 | 15       | 9000  |

**`Product` Table:**

| product\_id | product\_name |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| 100       | Nokia         |
| 200       | Apple         |
| 300       | Samsung       |

**Expected Output:**

| product\_name | year | price |
| ------------- | ---- | ----- |
| Nokia         | 2008 | 5000  |
| Nokia         | 2009 | 5000  |
| Apple         | 2011 | 9000  |

**Explanation of Example Output:**

The output is derived by joining the `Sales` and `Product` tables on `product_id`. For each `sale_id`, we look up the corresponding `product_name` from the `Product` table and combine it with the `year` and `price` from the `Sales` table.

*   **sale\_id = 1:**  `product_id` is 100, which corresponds to "Nokia" in the `Product` table. `year` is 2008, `price` is 5000. Output row: ("Nokia", 2008, 5000).
*   **sale\_id = 2:**  `product_id` is 100, which corresponds to "Nokia" in the `Product` table. `year` is 2009, `price` is 5000. Output row: ("Nokia", 2009, 5000).
*   **sale\_id = 7:**  `product_id` is 200, which corresponds to "Apple" in the `Product` table. `year` is 2011, `price` is 9000. Output row: ("Apple", 2011, 9000).

# Solution: Sales Report with Product Information

## Approach
To generate a report with product names, years, and prices for each sale:
1. Join the Sales table with the Product table to get product names
2. Select the required columns (product_name, year, price)
3. Maintain the relationship between sales and their corresponding products

## Solution
```sql
SELECT 
    p.product_name,
    s.year,
    s.price
FROM 
    Sales s
JOIN 
    Product p ON s.product_id = p.product_id;
```

## Explanation
1. The query performs an INNER JOIN between Sales and Product tables
2. The join condition matches product_id in both tables
3. We select:
   - product_name from the Product table
   - year and price from the Sales table
4. The result shows each sale with its corresponding product name

## Alternative Approach
Using explicit column selection with table aliases:
```sql
SELECT 
    Product.product_name,
    Sales.year, 
    Sales.price
FROM 
    Sales
INNER JOIN 
    Product ON Sales.product_id = Product.product_id;
```

**Key Differences**:
- The first solution uses table aliases (s, p) for brevity
- Both solutions produce identical results
- The INNER JOIN is explicit in the second version

**Performance Considerations**:
- An index on product_id in both tables would optimize the join
- The query only needs to access relevant columns
- Performance should be excellent for typical database sizes
