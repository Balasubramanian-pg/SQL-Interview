## Problem: Swap Salary Table Sex Values

Write a single SQL UPDATE statement to swap all 'f' and 'm' values in the `sex` column of the `Salary` table. That is, change all 'f' values to 'm' and all 'm' values to 'f'.

**Tables:**

### 1. `Salary` Table

This table contains information about employees and their salaries.

| Column Name | Type     | Description                                                                 |
| ----------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`          | `int`      | Primary key, unique identifier for each employee.                           |
| `name`        | `varchar`  | Name of the employee.                                                     |
| `sex`         | `ENUM`     | Sex of the employee, can be 'm' (male) or 'f' (female).                  |
| `salary`      | `int`      | Salary of the employee.                                                   |

**Primary Key:** `id`
**ENUM Values (sex):** ('m', 'f')

**Constraints:**

*   You must use a single `UPDATE` statement to modify the `sex` column.
*   You are not allowed to use any `SELECT` statements or intermediate temporary tables.
*   Swap 'f' to 'm' and 'm' to 'f' for all rows in the `Salary` table.

**Example Input:**

**`Salary` Table:**

| id  | name | sex | salary |
| --- | ---- | --- | ------ |
| 1   | A    | m   | 2500   |
| 2   | B    | f   | 1500   |
| 3   | C    | m   | 5500   |
| 4   | D    | f   | 500    |

**Expected Output:**

**`Salary` Table:**

| id  | name | sex | salary |
| --- | ---- | --- | ------ |
| 1   | A    | f   | 2500   |
| 2   | B    | m   | 1500   |
| 3   | C    | f   | 5500   |
| 4   | D    | m   | 500    |

**Explanation of Example Output:**

*   For employee 'A' (id=1) and 'C' (id=3), the `sex` value was changed from 'm' to 'f'.
*   For employee 'B' (id=2) and 'D' (id=4), the `sex` value was changed from 'f' to 'm'.
The `salary` and `name` columns remain unchanged.

#### Solution: Swapping Gender Values in Salary Table

## Approach
To swap all 'f' and 'm' values in the sex column with a single UPDATE statement, we can use a CASE expression to conditionally flip the values. This approach:
- Handles the ENUM type directly
- Doesn't require temporary tables
- Executes in a single statement as required

## Solution
```sql
UPDATE Salary
SET sex = CASE 
    WHEN sex = 'm' THEN 'f'
    WHEN sex = 'f' THEN 'm'
END;
```

## Explanation
1. The UPDATE statement modifies all rows in the Salary table
2. The CASE expression examines each sex value:
   - If sex is 'm', changes it to 'f'
   - If sex is 'f', changes it to 'm'
3. No ELSE clause is needed since the ENUM only contains 'm' and 'f'
4. The statement executes atomically as a single operation

## Alternative Approach
For databases that support the IF function more naturally:
```sql
UPDATE Salary
SET sex = IF(sex = 'm', 'f', 'm');
```

This achieves the same result with slightly more concise syntax, but may be less portable across different SQL implementations. The CASE version is more universally supported.
