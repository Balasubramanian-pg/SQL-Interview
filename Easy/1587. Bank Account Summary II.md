## Question: Report User Names and Balances for Users with Balance > 10000

**Table Schemas:**

**Table: `Users`**

```markdown
+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| account      | int     |
| name         | varchar |
+--------------+---------+
```

*   `account` is the primary key for this table.
*   Each row of this table contains the account number of each user in the bank.
*   There will be no two users having the same name in the table.

**Table: `Transactions`**

```markdown
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| trans_id      | int     |
| account       | int     |
| amount        | int     |
| transacted_on | date    |
+---------------+---------+
```

*   `trans_id` is the primary key for this table.
*   Each row of this table contains all changes made to all accounts.
*   `amount` is positive if the user received money and negative if they transferred money.
*   All accounts start with a balance of 0.

**Problem Statement:**

Write a solution to report the name and balance of users with a balance higher than 10000. The balance of an account is equal to the sum of the amounts of all transactions involving that account.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

**Input:**

**`Users` table:**

```markdown
+------------+--------------+
| account    | name         |
+------------+--------------+
| 900001     | Alice        |
| 900002     | Bob          |
| 900003     | Charlie      |
+------------+--------------+
```

**`Transactions` table:**

```markdown
+------------+------------+------------+---------------+
| trans_id   | account    | amount     | transacted_on |
+------------+------------+------------+---------------+
| 1          | 900001     | 7000       |  2020-08-01   |
| 2          | 900001     | 7000       |  2020-09-01   |
| 3          | 900001     | -3000      |  2020-09-02   |
| 4          | 900002     | 1000       |  2020-09-12   |
| 5          | 900003     | 6000       |  2020-08-07   |
| 6          | 900003     | 6000       |  2020-09-07   |
| 7          | 900003     | -4000      |  2020-09-11   |
+------------+------------+------------+---------------+
```

**Output:**

```markdown
+------------+------------+
| name       | balance    |
+------------+------------+
| Alice      | 11000      |
+------------+------------+
```

**Explanation:**

*   Alice's balance is (7000 + 7000 - 3000) = 11000.
*   Bob's balance is 1000.
*   Charlie's balance is (6000 + 6000 - 4000) = 8000.

# SQL Solution to Find Users with High Balances

Here's the solution to identify users with account balances exceeding 10,000:

```sql
SELECT 
    u.name,
    SUM(t.amount) AS balance
FROM 
    Users u
JOIN 
    Transactions t ON u.account = t.account
GROUP BY 
    u.account, u.name
HAVING 
    SUM(t.amount) > 10000
ORDER BY 
    balance DESC;
```

## Explanation:

1. **JOIN**: We join the Users table with Transactions to connect accounts with their transactions.

2. **SUM(t.amount)**: Calculates the total balance for each account by summing all transaction amounts (positive for deposits, negative for withdrawals).

3. **GROUP BY**: Groups the results by account and name to get one row per user.

4. **HAVING**: Filters to only include users with balances greater than 10,000.

5. **ORDER BY**: Sorts results by balance in descending order (optional, as the problem allows any order).

## Output:
The query returns exactly the expected output:
```
+------------+------------+
| name       | balance    |
+------------+------------+
| Alice      | 11000      |
+------------+------------+
```

This solution efficiently calculates account balances and filters for high-value accounts, matching all requirements in the problem statement. The JOIN ensures we only consider valid accounts, and the HAVING clause properly filters the results.
