Table: Person

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| personId    | int     |
| lastName    | varchar |
| firstName   | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
personId is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
This table contains information about the ID of some persons and their first and last names.

 

Table: Address

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| addressId   | int     |
| personId    | int     |
| city        | varchar |
| state       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
addressId is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about the city and state of one person with ID = PersonId.

 

Write a solution to report the first name, last name, city, and state of each person in the Person table. If the address of a personId is not present in the Address table, report null instead.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Person table:
+----------+----------+-----------+
| personId | lastName | firstName |
+----------+----------+-----------+
| 1        | Wang     | Allen     |
| 2        | Alice    | Bob       |
+----------+----------+-----------+
Address table:
+-----------+----------+---------------+------------+
| addressId | personId | city          | state      |
+-----------+----------+---------------+------------+
| 1         | 2        | New York City | New York   |
| 2         | 3        | Leetcode      | California |
+-----------+----------+---------------+------------+
Output: 
+-----------+----------+---------------+----------+
| firstName | lastName | city          | state    |
+-----------+----------+---------------+----------+
| Allen     | Wang     | Null          | Null     |
| Bob       | Alice    | New York City | New York |
+-----------+----------+---------------+----------+
Explanation: 
There is no address in the address table for the personId = 1 so we return null in their city and state.
addressId = 1 contains information about the address of personId = 2.

## Problem Understanding
We need to retrieve the first name, last name, city, and state for each person in the Person table. If a person doesn't have an address in the Address table, we should return null for city and state.

## Approach
This is a classic SQL join problem where we need to perform a LEFT JOIN between the Person table (left table) and the Address table (right table). A LEFT JOIN ensures that all records from the Person table are included in the result, even if there's no matching record in the Address table.

## Solution Code
```sql
SELECT 
    p.firstName,
    p.lastName,
    a.city,
    a.state
FROM 
    Person p
LEFT JOIN 
    Address a ON p.personId = a.personId;
```

## Explanation
1. **SELECT clause**: We specify the columns we want to retrieve - firstName and lastName from the Person table, and city and state from the Address table.
2. **FROM clause**: We start with the Person table as our base table.
3. **LEFT JOIN**: We join the Address table to the Person table using the personId as the join key. The LEFT JOIN ensures that all persons are included in the result, even if they don't have an address.
4. When there's no matching address for a person, the city and state columns will automatically be NULL in the result set.

This approach efficiently combines the data from both tables while handling cases where address information might be missing, exactly as required by the problem statement.

## Procedural Decomposition
1. **Identify required data**: First name, last name from Person; city, state from Address
2. **Determine join condition**: Match records where personId is equal in both tables
3. **Choose join type**: Use LEFT JOIN to preserve all Person records
4. **Handle missing data**: NULL values will appear automatically for non-matching records
5. **Format output**: Select and display the specified columns in any order
