# 182. Duplicate Emails

**1. The Question**

Given a table named `Person` with columns `id` and `email`, where `id` is the primary key and `email` contains lowercase email addresses (guaranteed not NULL), the task is to find and report all email addresses that appear more than once in the table.

**Table Schema:**

```
Person
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |  -- Primary Key
| email       | varchar |  -- Lowercase, Not NULL
+-------------+---------+
```

**Example Input:**

```
Person table:
+----+---------+
| id | email   |
+----+---------+
| 1  | a@b.com |
| 2  | c@d.com |
| 3  | a@b.com |
+----+---------+
```

**Desired Output:**

```
+---------+
| Email   |
+---------+
| a@b.com |
+---------+
```

**Explanation for Example:**
The email 'a@b.com' appears twice (for id 1 and id 3), so it is reported as a duplicate. 'c@d.com' appears only once.

**2. The Approach**

1.  **Identify the Target:** We need to find `email` values that are not unique.
2.  **Count Occurrences:** To determine if an email is duplicated, we need to count how many times each distinct email address appears in the table.
3.  **Grouping:** The `GROUP BY` clause is perfect for this. We can group the rows of the `Person` table based on the `email` column. This creates one group for each unique email address.
4.  **Counting within Groups:** Within each group, we can use an aggregate function like `COUNT(*)` or `COUNT(email)` to find the number of rows (and thus occurrences) for that specific email.
5.  **Filtering for Duplicates:** We are only interested in emails that appear *more than once*. After grouping and counting, we need to filter these groups. The `HAVING` clause is used to filter results *after* grouping, based on the result of aggregate functions. We will use `HAVING COUNT(email) > 1`.
6.  **Selecting the Output:** The final result should contain only the email addresses that meet the duplicate criteria. So, we `SELECT` the `email` column.
7.  **Output Column Name:** The example output shows the column name as `Email`. We use `AS Email` to alias the selected column.

**3. The Answer (SQL Solution)**

```sql
SELECT
    email AS Email -- Select the email address and alias the column as 'Email'
FROM
    Person         -- From the Person table
GROUP BY
    email          -- Group rows by the email address
HAVING
    COUNT(email) > 1; -- Filter the groups, keeping only those where the email count is greater than 1
```
