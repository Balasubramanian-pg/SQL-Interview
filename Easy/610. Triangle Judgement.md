## Problem: Triangle Formation

Report for every set of three line segments in the `Triangle` table whether they can form a valid triangle.

**Tables:**

### 1. `Triangle` Table

This table contains sets of three line segment lengths.

| Column Name | Type | Description                                                                 |
| ----------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `x`           | `int`  | Length of the first line segment.                                           |
| `y`           | `int`  | Length of the second line segment.                                          |
| `z`           | `int`  | Length of the third line segment.                                           |

**Primary Key:** (`x`, `y`, `z`)

**Triangle Formation Condition:**

Three line segments of lengths x, y, and z can form a triangle if and only if the sum of the lengths of any two sides is greater than the length of the third side.  This means all of the following conditions must be true:

*   x + y > z
*   x + z > y
*   y + z > x

**Constraints:**

*   For each row in the `Triangle` table, determine if the three lengths can form a triangle.
*   Return the original `x`, `y`, `z` values along with a column named `triangle`.
*   The `triangle` column should contain "Yes" if the segments can form a triangle, and "No" otherwise.
*   The result table can be in any order.

**Example Input:**

**`Triangle` Table:**

| x  | y  | z  |
| -- | -- | -- |
| 13 | 15 | 30 |
| 10 | 20 | 15 |

**Expected Output:**

| x  | y  | z  | triangle |
| -- | -- | -- | -------- |
| 13 | 15 | 30 | No       |
| 10 | 20 | 15 | Yes      |

**Explanation of Example Output:**

*   **Row 1 (x=13, y=15, z=30):**
    *   13 + 15 = 28, which is not greater than 30.
    *   Therefore, these segments cannot form a triangle. `triangle` = "No".
*   **Row 2 (x=10, y=20, z=15):**
    *   10 + 20 = 30, which is greater than 15.
    *   10 + 15 = 25, which is greater than 20.
    *   20 + 15 = 35, which is greater than 10.
    *   All conditions are met. Therefore, these segments can form a triangle. `triangle` = "Yes".

# Triangle Check Solution

## Procedural Decomposition

1. **Understand the Triangle Inequality Theorem**: For three lengths to form a triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side.
2. **Identify Required Checks**: For each row (x,y,z), we need to verify:
   - x + y > z
   - x + z > y
   - y + z > x
3. **Determine Output Format**: Return the original columns plus a 'triangle' column with 'Yes' or 'No' values.
4. **Handle Edge Cases**: Consider cases with zero or negative values (though constraints likely prevent these).

## Approach

1. **Row-by-Row Evaluation**: Process each row independently since the problem doesn't require cross-row calculations.
2. **Conditional Logic**: Use SQL's CASE statement to implement the triangle inequality checks.
3. **Boolean Evaluation**: Convert the three required inequalities into a single boolean expression.
4. **Result Formatting**: Present results in the specified format with original columns plus the triangle indicator.

## Solution

```sql
SELECT 
    x,
    y,
    z,
    CASE 
        WHEN x + y > z AND x + z > y AND y + z > x THEN 'Yes'
        ELSE 'No'
    END AS triangle
FROM Triangle;
```

**Explanation**:
- The query maintains all original columns (x, y, z)
- Adds a computed column 'triangle' that evaluates to 'Yes' or 'No'
- Uses a CASE statement to check all three triangle inequality conditions
- Returns the complete result set in the required format

## Alternative Approach

Using a more explicit boolean expression with IIF (SQL Server) or IF (MySQL):

```sql
-- SQL Server version with IIF
SELECT 
    x,
    y,
    z,
    IIF(x + y > z AND x + z > y AND y + z > x, 'Yes', 'No') AS triangle
FROM Triangle;

-- MySQL version with IF
SELECT 
    x,
    y,
    z,
    IF(x + y > z AND x + z > y AND y + z > x, 'Yes', 'No') AS triangle
FROM Triangle;
```

**Key Differences**:
- Uses database-specific conditional functions instead of CASE
- More concise syntax but less portable across SQL dialects
- Functionally equivalent to the CASE solution

**Performance Consideration**:
- Both approaches have identical performance characteristics
- The database will optimize the boolean expressions similarly
- No significant difference in execution plans
