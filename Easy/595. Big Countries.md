## 595. Big Countries

Find the name, population, and area of countries that are considered "big". A country is considered big if it meets either of the following criteria:

1.  It has an area of at least three million square kilometers (3,000,000 km²).
2.  It has a population of at least twenty-five million (25,000,000).

**Tables:**

### 1. `World` Table

This table contains information about countries.

| Column Name | Type    | Description                                                                |
| ----------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`        | `varchar` | Primary key, unique name of the country.                                  |
| `continent`   | `varchar` | Continent to which the country belongs.                                    |
| `area`        | `int`     | Area of the country in square kilometers (km²).                              |
| `population`  | `int`     | Population of the country.                                                 |
| `gdp`         | `bigint`  | Gross Domestic Product of the country.                                     |

**Primary Key:** `name`

**Constraints:**

*   Identify countries that satisfy *either* the area condition *or* the population condition (or both).
*   Return the `name`, `population`, and `area` for these big countries.
*   The result table can be in any order.

**Example Input:**

**`World` Table:**

| name        | continent | area    | population | gdp          |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| Afghanistan | Asia      | 652230  | 25500100   | 20343000000  |
| Albania     | Europe    | 28748   | 2831741    | 12960000000  |
| Algeria     | Africa    | 2381741 | 37100000   | 188681000000 |
| Andorra     | Europe    | 468     | 78115      | 3712000000   |
| Angola      | Africa    | 1246700 | 20609294   | 100990000000 |

**Expected Output:**

| name        | population | area    |
| ----------- | ---------- | ------- |
| Afghanistan | 25500100   | 652230  |
| Algeria     | 37100000   | 2381741 |

**Explanation of Example Output:**

*   **Afghanistan:** Area (652,230 km²) is less than 3,000,000 km², but population (25,500,100) is greater than 25,000,000.  Therefore, Afghanistan is a big country.
*   **Albania:** Area (28,748 km²) is less than 3,000,000 km², and population (2,831,741) is less than 25,000,000. Therefore, Albania is not a big country.
*   **Algeria:** Area (2,381,741 km²) is less than 3,000,000 km², but population (37,100,000) is greater than 25,000,000. Therefore, Algeria is a big country.
*   **Andorra:** Area (468 km²) is less than 3,000,000 km², and population (78,115) is less than 25,000,000. Therefore, Andorra is not a big country.
*   **Angola:** Area (1,246,700 km²) is less than 3,000,000 km², and population (20,609,294) is less than 25,000,000. Therefore, Angola is not a big country.

Thus, only Afghanistan and Algeria are identified as big countries based on the given criteria.

## Understanding the Problem

We need to identify "big" countries based on either:
1. Area ≥ 3 million km², OR
2. Population ≥ 25 million

We should return the name, population, and area of these countries.

## Solution

```sql
SELECT 
    name,
    population,
    area
FROM 
    World
WHERE 
    area >= 3000000 OR population >= 25000000;
```

## Explanation

1. **Selection Criteria**:
   - `area >= 3000000` checks for large area countries
   - `population >= 25000000` checks for highly populated countries
   - `OR` operator ensures either condition qualifies a country as "big"

2. **Output Columns**:
   - We select the country name, population, and area as requested

3. **Example Walkthrough**:
   - Afghanistan: Population 25,500,100 (≥25M) → included
   - Albania: Neither condition met → excluded
   - Algeria: Population 37,100,000 (≥25M) → included
   - Andorra: Neither condition met → excluded
   - Angola: Population 20,609,294 (<25M), area 1,246,700 (<3M) → excluded

## Alternative Solution (Using UNION)

For databases where OR optimization is poor, you could use:

```sql
SELECT name, population, area
FROM World
WHERE area >= 3000000

UNION

SELECT name, population, area
FROM World
WHERE population >= 25000000;
```

This produces the same result but may perform better in some database systems.
