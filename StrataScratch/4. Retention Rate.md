# Simplified Retention Rate Calculation

Here's a more concise version of the query that still calculates the retention rate ratio:

```sql
WITH 
monthly_active_users AS (
  SELECT
    account_id,
    user_id,
    DATE_TRUNC('month', record_date) AS month
  FROM sf_events
  WHERE DATE_TRUNC('month', record_date) IN ('2020-12-01', '2021-01-01')
),

retention_status AS (
  SELECT
    m.account_id,
    m.month,
    m.user_id,
    MAX(CASE 
          WHEN m.month = '2020-12-01' AND EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM sf_events 
            WHERE user_id = m.user_id 
            AND account_id = m.account_id 
            AND record_date > '2020-12-31'
          ) THEN 1
          WHEN m.month = '2021-01-01' AND EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM sf_events 
            WHERE user_id = m.user_id 
            AND account_id = m.account_id 
            AND record_date > '2021-01-31'
          ) THEN 1
          ELSE 0
        END) AS is_retained
  FROM monthly_active_users m
  GROUP BY m.account_id, m.month, m.user_id
),

retention_rates AS (
  SELECT
    account_id,
    SUM(CASE WHEN month = '2020-12-01' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS dec_users,
    SUM(CASE WHEN month = '2020-12-01' AND is_retained = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS dec_retained,
    SUM(CASE WHEN month = '2021-01-01' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS jan_users,
    SUM(CASE WHEN month = '2021-01-01' AND is_retained = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS jan_retained
  FROM retention_status
  GROUP BY account_id
)

SELECT
  account_id,
  CASE 
    WHEN dec_retained = 0 THEN 0
    ELSE (jan_retained::float / NULLIF(jan_users, 0)) / 
         (dec_retained::float / NULLIF(dec_users, 0))
  END AS retention_rate_ratio
FROM retention_rates
WHERE dec_users > 0 OR jan_users > 0
ORDER BY account_id;
```

### Key Simplifications:

1. **Combined active user identification** into a single CTE
2. **Used EXISTS clauses** to check for retained users instead of joins
3. **Streamlined the retention calculation** with fewer intermediate steps
4. **Simplified the final ratio calculation** by directly using counts

This version maintains all the original functionality while being more concise and easier to understand. It still:
- Calculates retention for both December 2020 and January 2021
- Handles edge cases (division by zero)
- Returns the ratio of January retention to December retention
- Only includes accounts with activity in either month
