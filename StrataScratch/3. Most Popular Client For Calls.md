# Most Popular Client Based on Users with ≥50% Call Events

To find the most popular client_id based on users who have at least 50% of their events as call-related events, I'll need to:

1. Identify call-related event types
2. Calculate the percentage of call events for each user
3. Count users with ≥50% call events per client
4. Select the client with the highest count

## SQL Solution

```sql
WITH user_call_percentages AS (
  SELECT 
    user_id,
    client_id,
    COUNT(*) AS total_events,
    SUM(CASE WHEN event_type IN (
          'video call received', 
          'video call sent', 
          'voice call received', 
          'voice call sent'
        ) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS call_events
  FROM fact_events
  GROUP BY user_id, client_id
),

qualified_users AS (
  SELECT 
    client_id,
    user_id
  FROM user_call_percentages
  WHERE call_events * 100.0 / total_events >= 50
)

SELECT 
  client_id
FROM qualified_users
GROUP BY client_id
ORDER BY COUNT(user_id) DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

## Explanation:

1. First CTE (`user_call_percentages`) calculates:
   - Total events per user per client
   - Count of call-related events per user per client

2. Second CTE (`qualified_users`) filters for users where:
   - Call events make up ≥50% of their total events

3. Final query:
   - Counts qualified users per client
   - Orders by count descending
   - Returns just the top client

Based on your sample output, the most popular client is 'desktop', meaning more users on desktop meet the ≥50% call events criteria than on mobile or other clients.
