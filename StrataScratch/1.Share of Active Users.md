# Calculating Percentage of US Users with 'Open' Status

## Input Structure
The input is a table named `fb_active_users` with the following columns:
- `country` (text): The country of the user
- `name` (text): The name of the user
- `status` (text): The account status (including 'open')
- `user_id` (bigint): Unique identifier for each user

## Output Structure
The output should be a single value representing the percentage of users who:
1. Are from the US (`country = 'US'`)
2. Have an 'open' status (`status = 'open'`)

The percentage should be calculated as:
```
(Number of US users with open status / Total number of users) Ã— 100
```

## SQL Solution

```sql
SELECT 
    (COUNT(CASE WHEN country = 'US' AND status = 'open' THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / 
     COUNT(*)) AS percentage_us_open_users
FROM 
    fb_active_users;
```

## Alternative with Rounded Result

```sql
SELECT 
    ROUND(
        (COUNT(CASE WHEN country = 'US' AND status = 'open' THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / 
        COUNT(*),
        2
    ) AS percentage_us_open_users
FROM 
    fb_active_users;
```

This query:
1. Counts all users who meet both conditions (US and open status)
2. Divides by the total count of users
3. Multiplies by 100 to get a percentage
4. (Optional) Rounds to 2 decimal places for cleaner output
