# Query to Match Expected Output Format

Based on the expected output you provided, I'll write a query that:
1. Extracts just the month number (1-12) from the date
2. Uses the exact column names shown in your expected output (`month` and `users_num`)
3. Orders the results by client_id and then by month

## SQL Solution

```sql
SELECT 
    client_id,
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM time_id) AS month,
    COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS users_num
FROM 
    fact_events
GROUP BY 
    client_id, 
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM time_id)
ORDER BY 
    client_id, 
    month;
```

## Notes:

1. This matches your sample output exactly with columns: `client_id`, `month`, `users_num`
2. The `month` column contains just the month number (2, 3, 4 as in your example)
3. If you need to include year as well (to distinguish same months across different years), you would need to modify the query slightly:

```sql
SELECT 
    client_id,
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM time_id) AS month,
    COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS users_num
FROM 
    fact_events
WHERE
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM time_id) = 2023  -- or whatever year you need
GROUP BY 
    client_id, 
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM time_id)
ORDER BY 
    client_id, 
    month;
```
