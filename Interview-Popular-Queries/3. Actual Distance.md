# Finding Actual Distance Traveled Each Day

To calculate the actual distance traveled each day (rather than the cumulative distance), we need to find the difference between consecutive days' cumulative distances for each car.

Here are 5 solutions to solve this problem:

## Solution 1: Using LAG Window Function (Most Efficient)
```sql
SELECT 
    cars,
    days,
    cumulative_distance - LAG(cumulative_distance, 1, 0) OVER (
        PARTITION BY cars 
        ORDER BY days
    ) AS actual_distance
FROM cars_travel;
```

## Solution 2: Using Self-Join
```sql
SELECT 
    t1.cars,
    t1.days,
    t1.cumulative_distance - COALESCE(t2.cumulative_distance, 0) AS actual_distance
FROM cars_travel t1
LEFT JOIN cars_travel t2 ON t1.cars = t2.cars 
    AND t2.days = (
        SELECT MAX(days) 
        FROM cars_travel t3 
        WHERE t3.cars = t1.cars AND t3.days < t1.days
    );
```

## Solution 3: Using Subquery
```sql
SELECT 
    cars,
    days,
    cumulative_distance - COALESCE(
        (SELECT cumulative_distance 
         FROM cars_travel t2 
         WHERE t2.cars = t1.cars AND t2.days < t1.days 
         ORDER BY t2.days DESC 
         LIMIT 1), 0
    ) AS actual_distance
FROM cars_travel t1;
```

## Solution 4: Using Common Table Expression (CTE) with ROW_NUMBER
```sql
WITH numbered_days AS (
    SELECT 
        cars,
        days,
        cumulative_distance,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY cars ORDER BY days) AS row_num
    FROM cars_travel
)
SELECT 
    n1.cars,
    n1.days,
    n1.cumulative_distance - COALESCE(n2.cumulative_distance, 0) AS actual_distance
FROM numbered_days n1
LEFT JOIN numbered_days n2 ON n1.cars = n2.cars AND n1.row_num = n2.row_num + 1;
```

## Solution 5: Using FIRST_VALUE (Alternative Window Function)
```sql
SELECT 
    cars,
    days,
    cumulative_distance - FIRST_VALUE(cumulative_distance) OVER (
        PARTITION BY cars, grp
        ORDER BY days
        ROWS BETWEEN 1 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) AS actual_distance
FROM (
    SELECT 
        cars,
        days,
        cumulative_distance,
        SUM(CASE WHEN days = 'Day1' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) OVER (
            PARTITION BY cars 
            ORDER BY days
        ) AS grp
    FROM cars_travel
) t;
```

### Expected Result:
```
cars | days | actual_distance
-----|------|----------------
Car1 | Day1 | 50
Car1 | Day2 | 50  (100-50)
Car1 | Day3 | 100 (200-100)
Car2 | Day1 | 0
Car3 | Day1 | 0
Car3 | Day2 | 50  (50-0)
Car3 | Day3 | 0   (50-50)
Car3 | Day4 | 50  (100-50)
```

The LAG window function (Solution 1) is typically the most efficient approach for this type of calculation.
