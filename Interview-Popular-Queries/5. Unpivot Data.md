# SQL Query to Ungroup Data

## Problem Understanding
We need to transform the grouped data (with counts) into individual rows for each item. For example, "Water Bottle" with total_count=2 should become two separate rows of "Water Bottle".

## Solution

```sql
WITH numbers AS (
    SELECT generate_series(1, (SELECT MAX(total_count) FROM items)) AS n
)
SELECT 
    i.id,
    i.item_name,
    1 AS count_per_item
FROM 
    items i
JOIN 
    numbers n ON n.n <= i.total_count
ORDER BY 
    i.id, n.n;
```

## Alternative Solutions

### Solution 1: Using Recursive CTE
```sql
WITH RECURSIVE ungrouped AS (
    SELECT 
        id, 
        item_name, 
        1 AS iteration, 
        total_count
    FROM items
    
    UNION ALL
    
    SELECT 
        id, 
        item_name, 
        iteration + 1, 
        total_count
    FROM ungrouped
    WHERE iteration < total_count
)
SELECT 
    id, 
    item_name,
    1 AS count_per_item
FROM ungrouped
ORDER BY id, iteration;
```

### Solution 2: Using CROSS JOIN with Series
```sql
SELECT 
    i.id,
    i.item_name,
    1 AS count_per_item
FROM 
    items i
CROSS JOIN 
    generate_series(1, i.total_count) AS s(n)
ORDER BY 
    i.id, s.n;
```

## Expected Output
```
id | item_name  | count_per_item
---|------------|--------------
1  | Water Bottle | 1
1  | Water Bottle | 1
2  | Tent         | 1
3  | Apple        | 1
3  | Apple        | 1
3  | Apple        | 1
3  | Apple        | 1
```

The solutions work by:
1. Generating a series of numbers up to the maximum count
2. Joining each item with numbers up to its total_count
3. Returning one row per count with a value of 1 in count_per_item

The CROSS JOIN with generate_series (Solution 2) is typically the most efficient approach for this transformation.
