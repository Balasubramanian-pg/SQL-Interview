QUERY 6	Derive IPL macthes	
PROBLEM STATEMENT	There are 10 IPL team. 	
	1) Write an sql query such that each team play with every other team just once. 	
	2) Write an sql query such that each team play with every other team twice.	

# SQL Queries for IPL Match Scheduling

## 1. Each team plays every other team once (Single Round Robin)

```sql
SELECT 
    t1.team_code AS team1,
    t1.team_name AS team1_name,
    t2.team_code AS team2,
    t2.team_name AS team2_name
FROM 
    teams t1
JOIN 
    teams t2 ON t1.team_code < t2.team_code
ORDER BY 
    t1.team_code, t2.team_code;
```

## 2. Each team plays every other team twice (Double Round Robin - Home & Away)

```sql
SELECT 
    t1.team_code AS team1,
    t1.team_name AS team1_name,
    t2.team_code AS team2,
    t2.team_name AS team2_name,
    'Home' AS match_type
FROM 
    teams t1
JOIN 
    teams t2 ON t1.team_code != t2.team_code
WHERE 
    t1.team_code < t2.team_code

UNION ALL

SELECT 
    t2.team_code AS team1,
    t2.team_name AS team1_name,
    t1.team_code AS team2,
    t1.team_name AS team2_name,
    'Away' AS match_type
FROM 
    teams t1
JOIN 
    teams t2 ON t1.team_code != t2.team_code
WHERE 
    t1.team_code < t2.team_code

ORDER BY 
    team1, team2, match_type;
```

## Alternative Solutions

### Using CROSS JOIN with Filter (Single Round Robin)
```sql
SELECT 
    t1.team_code AS team1,
    t1.team_name AS team1_name,
    t2.team_code AS team2,
    t2.team_name AS team2_name
FROM 
    teams t1
CROSS JOIN 
    teams t2
WHERE 
    t1.team_code < t2.team_code
ORDER BY 
    t1.team_code, t2.team_code;
```

### Using Self-Join with CASE (Double Round Robin)
```sql
SELECT 
    t1.team_code AS team1,
    t1.team_name AS team1_name,
    t2.team_code AS team2,
    t2.team_name AS team2_name,
    CASE WHEN t1.team_code < t2.team_code THEN 'Home' ELSE 'Away' END AS match_type
FROM 
    teams t1
JOIN 
    teams t2 ON t1.team_code != t2.team_code
ORDER BY 
    LEAST(t1.team_code, t2.team_code),
    GREATEST(t1.team_code, t2.team_code),
    match_type;
```

These queries will generate:
1. 45 matches (10 teams × 9 opponents / 2) for single round robin
2. 90 matches (45 × 2) for double round robin (home and away)

The key technique is using a self-join with appropriate join conditions to avoid:
- Teams playing against themselves
- Duplicate matches (e.g., RCB vs MI and MI vs RCB counting as the same match in single round robin)
