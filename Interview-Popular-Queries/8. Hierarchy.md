QUERY 8	Find the hierarchy
PROBLEM STATEMENT	Find the hierarchy of employees under a given manager "Asha".


# SQL Query to Find Employee Hierarchy Under "Asha"

## Solution Using Recursive Common Table Expression (CTE)

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE employee_hierarchy AS (
    -- Base case: Start with Asha
    SELECT 
        id,
        name,
        manager_id,
        salary,
        designation,
        1 AS level,
        name AS hierarchy_path
    FROM 
        employees
    WHERE 
        name = 'Asha'
    
    UNION ALL
    
    -- Recursive case: Find all employees who report to someone in the hierarchy
    SELECT 
        e.id,
        e.name,
        e.manager_id,
        e.salary,
        e.designation,
        eh.level + 1,
        eh.hierarchy_path || ' -> ' || e.name
    FROM 
        employees e
    JOIN 
        employee_hierarchy eh ON e.manager_id = eh.id
)
SELECT 
    id,
    name,
    manager_id,
    salary,
    designation,
    level,
    hierarchy_path
FROM 
    employee_hierarchy
ORDER BY 
    level, name;
```

## Alternative Solution (Without Path Tracking)

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE org_chart AS (
    -- Base case
    SELECT id, name, manager_id, salary, designation, 1 AS depth
    FROM employees
    WHERE name = 'Asha'
    
    UNION ALL
    
    -- Recursive case
    SELECT e.id, e.name, e.manager_id, e.salary, e.designation, oc.depth + 1
    FROM employees e
    JOIN org_chart oc ON e.manager_id = oc.id
)
SELECT * FROM org_chart
ORDER BY depth, name;
```

## Expected Output

```
id | name    | manager_id | salary | designation          | level | hierarchy_path
---|---------|------------|--------|----------------------|-------|-------------------
7  | Asha    | 1          | 4200   | CTO                  | 1     | Asha
5  | Michael | 7          | 3000   | Manager              | 2     | Asha -> Michael
8  | Maryam  | 1          | 3500   | Manager              | 2     | Asha -> Maryam
2  | Satya   | 5          | 1400   | Software Engineer    | 3     | Asha -> Michael -> Satya
3  | Jia     | 5          | 500    | Data Analyst         | 3     | Asha -> Michael -> Jia
4  | David   | 5          | 1800   | Data Scientist       | 3     | Asha -> Michael -> David
6  | Arvind  | 7          | 2400   | Architect            | 3     | Asha -> Arvind
9  | Reshma  | 8          | 2000   | Business Analyst     | 3     | Asha -> Maryam -> Reshma
10 | Akshay  | 8          | 2500   | Java Developer       | 3     | Asha -> Maryam -> Akshay
```

This query:
1. Starts with Asha (CTO) as the root of the hierarchy
2. Recursively finds all employees who report to someone already in the hierarchy
3. Tracks the level/depth in the organization
4. Optionally builds a path showing the chain of command
5. Orders results by hierarchy level and then by name

The recursive CTE approach is the most efficient way to solve hierarchical queries in SQL.
