# SQL Query to Find Monthly Sales Difference Between 2003 and 2004

```sql
WITH monthly_sales_2003 AS (
    SELECT 
        month_id,
        AVG(sales) AS avg_sales_2003
    FROM orders
    WHERE year_id = 2003
    GROUP BY month_id
),
monthly_sales_2004 AS (
    SELECT 
        month_id,
        AVG(sales) AS avg_sales_2004
    FROM orders
    WHERE year_id = 2004
    GROUP BY month_id
)
SELECT 
    COALESCE(m03.month_id, m04.month_id) AS month,
    m03.avg_sales_2003,
    m04.avg_sales_2004,
    ROUND(COALESCE(m04.avg_sales_2004, 0) - COALESCE(m03.avg_sales_2003, 0), 2) AS sales_difference
FROM 
    monthly_sales_2003 m03
FULL OUTER JOIN 
    monthly_sales_2004 m04 ON m03.month_id = m04.month_id
ORDER BY 
    month;
```

## Alternative Solution (More Concise)

```sql
SELECT 
    month_id AS month,
    AVG(CASE WHEN year_id = 2003 THEN sales END) AS avg_sales_2003,
    AVG(CASE WHEN year_id = 2004 THEN sales END) AS avg_sales_2004,
    ROUND(
        COALESCE(AVG(CASE WHEN year_id = 2004 THEN sales END), 0) - 
        COALESCE(AVG(CASE WHEN year_id = 2003 THEN sales END), 0), 
    2
    ) AS sales_difference
FROM 
    orders
WHERE 
    year_id IN (2003, 2004)
GROUP BY 
    month_id
ORDER BY 
    month_id;
```

## Expected Output Example:

```
month | avg_sales_2003 | avg_sales_2004 | sales_difference
------|----------------|----------------|-----------------
1     | 4708.44        | 3965.66        | -742.78
2     | 2818.43        | 3676.76        | 858.33
3     | 2871.00        | NULL           | -2871.00
4     | NULL           | 2333.12        | 2333.12
5     | 2765.90        | NULL           | -2765.90
6     | NULL           | 3676.76        | 3676.76
7     | 3884.34        | 4177.35        | 293.01
8     | 3746.70        | 4099.68        | 352.98
9     | NULL           | 2597.39        | 2597.39
10    | 5205.27        | 4394.38        | -810.89
11    | 4007.22        | 4516.38        | 509.16
12    | 2168.54        | 1451.00        | -717.54
```

This query:
1. Calculates average sales for each month in 2003
2. Calculates average sales for each month in 2004
3. Computes the difference between 2004 and 2003 averages
4. Uses FULL OUTER JOIN to include all months from both years
5. Handles NULL values with COALESCE to properly calculate differences
6. Rounds the difference to 2 decimal places for readability
