# 7 Solutions to Delete Duplicate Records from CARS Table

## Understanding the Problem
The table contains duplicate records where multiple rows have identical `model_name`, `color`, and `brand` values (e.g., Leaf Black Nissan appears twice, Ioniq 5 Black Hyundai appears twice).

Here are 7 different solutions to delete these duplicates:

### Solution 1: Using GROUP BY with MIN/MAX model_id
```sql
DELETE FROM cars
WHERE model_id NOT IN (
    SELECT MIN(model_id)
    FROM cars
    GROUP BY model_name, color, brand
);
```

### Solution 2: Using ROW_NUMBER() window function
```sql
DELETE FROM cars
WHERE model_id IN (
    SELECT model_id
    FROM (
        SELECT model_id,
               ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY model_name, color, brand ORDER BY model_id) AS rn
        FROM cars
    ) t
    WHERE rn > 1
);
```

### Solution 3: Using a temporary table
```sql
CREATE TABLE cars_temp AS
SELECT MIN(model_id) AS model_id, model_name, color, brand
FROM cars
GROUP BY model_name, color, brand;

TRUNCATE TABLE cars;

INSERT INTO cars
SELECT * FROM cars_temp;

DROP TABLE cars_temp;
```

### Solution 4: Using EXISTS to find duplicates
```sql
DELETE FROM cars c1
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM cars c2
    WHERE c2.model_name = c1.model_name
    AND c2.color = c1.color
    AND c2.brand = c1.brand
    AND c2.model_id < c1.model_id
);
```

### Solution 5: Using a self-join
```sql
DELETE FROM cars
WHERE model_id IN (
    SELECT c1.model_id
    FROM cars c1
    JOIN cars c2 ON c1.model_name = c2.model_name
                AND c1.color = c2.color
                AND c1.brand = c2.brand
                AND c1.model_id > c2.model_id
);
```

### Solution 6: Using CTE with RANK()
```sql
WITH ranked_cars AS (
    SELECT model_id,
           RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY model_name, color, brand ORDER BY model_id) AS rnk
    FROM cars
)
DELETE FROM cars
WHERE model_id IN (
    SELECT model_id FROM ranked_cars WHERE rnk > 1
);
```

### Solution 7: Using DISTINCT ON (PostgreSQL specific)
```sql
DELETE FROM cars
WHERE model_id NOT IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT ON (model_name, color, brand) model_id
    FROM cars
    ORDER BY model_name, color, brand, model_id
);
```

All these solutions will leave one unique record for each combination of model_name, color, and brand, keeping the record with the lowest model_id. Choose the one that best fits your database system and performance requirements.
