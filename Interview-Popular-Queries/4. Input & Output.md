# SQL Query to Normalize Route Directions

## Problem Understanding
The table contains bidirectional route data where each route appears twice (A→B and B→A). We need to normalize this to show each unique route only once, regardless of direction.

## Solution

```sql
SELECT 
    CASE WHEN source < destination THEN source ELSE destination END AS city1,
    CASE WHEN source > destination THEN source ELSE destination END AS city2,
    distance
FROM routes
GROUP BY 
    CASE WHEN source < destination THEN source ELSE destination END,
    CASE WHEN source > destination THEN source ELSE destination END,
    distance;
```

## Alternative Solutions

### Solution 1: Using DISTINCT with CASE
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT
    LEAST(source, destination) AS city1,
    GREATEST(source, destination) AS city2,
    distance
FROM routes;
```

### Solution 2: Using Window Functions
```sql
WITH normalized_routes AS (
    SELECT 
        source,
        destination,
        distance,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
            PARTITION BY 
                CASE WHEN source < destination THEN source ELSE destination END,
                CASE WHEN source > destination THEN source ELSE destination END,
                distance
            ORDER BY source
        ) AS rn
    FROM routes
)
SELECT 
    CASE WHEN source < destination THEN source ELSE destination END AS city1,
    CASE WHEN source > destination THEN source ELSE destination END AS city2,
    distance
FROM normalized_routes
WHERE rn = 1;
```

### Solution 3: Using MIN/MAX Aggregation
```sql
SELECT 
    MIN(source, destination) AS city1,
    MAX(source, destination) AS city2,
    distance
FROM routes
GROUP BY 
    MIN(source, destination),
    MAX(source, destination),
    distance;
```

## Expected Output
```
city1     | city2     | distance
----------|-----------|---------
Bangalore | Hyderabad | 400
Delhi     | Mumbai    | 400
Chennai   | Pune      | 400
```

Note: The solution assumes all bidirectional routes have the same distance. If distances might differ, you would need to handle that case differently (e.g., by averaging or taking the minimum/maximum distance).
