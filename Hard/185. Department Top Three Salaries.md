# Department Highest Salary Problem
```markdown

## Table Schemas

### Employee Table

| Column Name  | Type    |
|--------------|---------|
| id           | int     |
| name         | varchar |
| salary       | int     |
| departmentId | int     |

* `id` is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
* `departmentId` is a foreign key (reference column) of the ID from the `Department` table.
* Each row of this table indicates the ID, name, and salary of an employee. It also contains the ID of their department.

### Department Table

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |

* `id` is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
* Each row of this table indicates the ID of a department and its name.

## Problem Statement

A company's executives are interested in seeing who earns the most money in each of the company's departments. A **high earner** in a department is an employee who has a salary in the **top three unique salaries** for that department.

Write a solution to find the employees who are high earners in each of the departments.

Return the result table in any order.

## Example

### Input

**Employee table:**

| id | name  | salary | departmentId |
|----|-------|--------|--------------|
| 1  | Joe   | 85000  | 1            |
| 2  | Henry | 80000  | 2            |
| 3  | Sam   | 60000  | 2            |
| 4  | Max   | 90000  | 1            |
| 5  | Janet | 69000  | 1            |
| 6  | Randy | 85000  | 1            |
| 7  | Will  | 70000  | 1            |

**Department table:**

| id | name  |
|----|-------|
| 1  | IT    |
| 2  | Sales |

### Output

| Department | Employee | Salary |
|------------|----------|--------|
| IT         | Max      | 90000  |
| IT         | Joe      | 85000  |
| IT         | Randy    | 85000  |
| IT         | Will     | 70000  |
| Sales      | Henry    | 80000  |
| Sales      | Sam      | 60000  |

### Explanation

* **In the IT department:**
    * Max earns the highest unique salary (90000).
    * Both Randy and Joe earn the second-highest unique salary (85000).
    * Will earns the third-highest unique salary (70000).
* **In the Sales department:**
    * Henry earns the highest salary (80000).
    * Sam earns the second-highest salary (60000).
    * There is no third-highest salary as there are only two employees (and two unique salaries).

## Constraints

* There are no employees with the exact same name, salary and department.

## Question Breakdown

The problem requires us to find the top 3 highest earners in each department. This involves:

1.  **Grouping by Department:** We need to consider employees within each department separately.
2.  **Ranking Salaries:** Within each department, we need to rank employees based on their salaries (considering unique salary levels).
3.  **Filtering Top 3:** We need to select only those employees whose salary falls into the top 3 unique salary ranks for their department.
4.  **Joining Tables:** We need to join the `Employee` and `Department` tables to display the department name along with the employee's information.

## Solution Approach

We can solve this using SQL. Common approaches involve subqueries or window functions.

1.  **Subquery Approach:** Find the top 3 distinct salaries for each department in a subquery and then select employees whose salary is in that list for their respective department.
2.  **Window Function Approach (using `DENSE_RANK()`):** `DENSE_RANK()` is a window function that assigns ranks to rows within a partition (department in this case) based on the salary. It handles ties by assigning the same rank to tied values and doesn't skip ranks. This is ideal for finding the top N *unique* values.
    * **Partition by Department:** Use the `PARTITION BY` clause in `DENSE_RANK()` to reset the rank for each department.
    * **Order by Salary:** Order by salary descending within each partition.
    * **Filter by Rank:** Filter the results to include only those employees whose `dense_rank` is less than or equal to 3.
    * **Join with Department Table:** Join the results with the `Department` table to get the department name.

## SQL Solutions

### Solution 1: Using Subquery with `IN`

```sql
SELECT
    d.name AS Department,
    e.name AS Employee,
    e.salary AS Salary
FROM
    Employee e
JOIN
    Department d ON e.departmentId = d.id
WHERE
    e.salary IN (
        SELECT DISTINCT salary
        FROM Employee
        WHERE departmentId = e.departmentId
        ORDER BY salary DESC
        LIMIT 3
    )
ORDER BY
    d.name,
    e.salary DESC;
```

#### Explanation:

1.  **`SELECT d.name AS Department, e.name AS Employee, e.salary AS Salary`**: Selects the required columns for the output, aliasing them for clarity.
2.  **`FROM Employee e JOIN Department d ON e.departmentId = d.id`**: Joins the `Employee` table (`e`) with the `Department` table (`d`) on their common ID (`departmentId` and `id`).
3.  **`WHERE e.salary IN (...)`**: Filters the joined results. An employee is included only if their salary exists within the list generated by the subquery.
4.  **`SELECT DISTINCT salary FROM Employee WHERE departmentId = e.departmentId ORDER BY salary DESC LIMIT 3`**: This is a correlated subquery. For *each* employee `e` from the outer query, it finds the top 3 *distinct* salaries within that employee's specific department (`WHERE departmentId = e.departmentId`).
5.  **`ORDER BY d.name, e.salary DESC`**: Orders the final result set first by department name alphabetically and then by salary in descending order within each department.

*Note: The specific syntax for `LIMIT` might vary slightly depending on the SQL dialect (e.g., `TOP 3` in SQL Server).*

### Solution 2: Using Window Function (`DENSE_RANK`)

```sql
WITH RankedEmployees AS (
    SELECT
        e.name AS Employee,
        e.salary AS Salary,
        e.departmentId,
        DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY e.departmentId ORDER BY e.salary DESC) AS rank_within_department
    FROM
        Employee e
)
SELECT
    d.name AS Department,
    re.Employee,
    re.Salary
FROM
    RankedEmployees re
JOIN
    Department d ON re.departmentId = d.id
WHERE
    re.rank_within_department <= 3
ORDER BY
    Department,
    Salary DESC;

```

#### Explanation:

1.  **`WITH RankedEmployees AS (...)`**: Defines a Common Table Expression (CTE) named `RankedEmployees` to make the query more readable.
2.  **`SELECT ..., DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY e.departmentId ORDER BY e.salary DESC) AS rank_within_department`**: This is the core of the ranking logic within the CTE.
    * `DENSE_RANK()`: Assigns a rank based on the `ORDER BY` clause within each partition. Crucially, it assigns the same rank to tied salaries and does not skip ranks (e.g., 1, 2, 2, 3).
    * `PARTITION BY e.departmentId`: Divides the data into partitions based on the department. The ranking restarts for each department.
    * `ORDER BY e.salary DESC`: Specifies that ranking should be based on salary in descending order (highest salary gets rank 1).
3.  **`SELECT d.name AS Department, re.Employee, re.Salary FROM RankedEmployees re JOIN Department d ON re.departmentId = d.id`**: Selects the required columns, joining the CTE (`re`) with the `Department` table (`d`) to get the department name.
4.  **`WHERE re.rank_within_department <= 3`**: Filters the results to include only those employees whose calculated rank within their department is 1, 2, or 3.
5.  **`ORDER BY Department, Salary DESC`**: Orders the final result set by department name and then by salary descending.

Both solutions achieve the desired outcome. The window function approach is often preferred for its readability and potential performance benefits in complex ranking scenarios.
