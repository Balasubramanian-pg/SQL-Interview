# 3374. First Letter Capitalization

**1. Problem:**

**Task:** Transform text in the `content_text` column of the `user_content` table according to these rules:

*   **Rule 1: Word Capitalization:** Convert the first letter of each word to uppercase and the rest to lowercase.
*   **Rule 2: Hyphenated Words:** For words connected with a hyphen (`-`), capitalize the first letter of each part (before and after the hyphen).
*   **Rule 3: Preserve Formatting:** Keep all other formatting and spacing (like multiple spaces, tabs, etc.) exactly as they are in the original text.

**Example:**

*   Input: `"web-based FRONT-end development"`
*   Output: `"Web-Based Front-End Development"`

To approach this problem systematically, follow these structured steps:

---

### **1. Understand the Requirements**
- **Core Objective**: Transform text such that each word's first letter is uppercase, and the rest are lowercase. Handle hyphenated words by capitalizing each segment.
- **Key Rules**:
  - Capitalize after spaces (new words).
  - Capitalize after hyphens (new segments in hyphenated words).
  - Preserve original spacing and hyphens.

---

### **2. Break Down the Problem**
- **Character-by-Character Processing**: Since formatting depends on preceding characters (spaces/hyphens), process each character sequentially.
- **Track Capitalization State**: Use a flag to track whether the next character should be capitalized (e.g., after a space/hyphen).

---

### **3. Choose the Right Tools**
- **Recursive CTE**: To iterate through each character position in the string.
- **String Functions**: `SUBSTRING`, `UPPER`, `LOWER` for character manipulation.
- **Aggregation**: `GROUP_CONCAT` to rebuild the transformed string.

---

### **4. Design the Algorithm**
1. **Initialize**: Start with the first character, capitalize it, and set the `next_cap` flag based on whether it’s a space/hyphen.
2. **Recursive Step**:
   - For each subsequent character:
     - Capitalize if `next_cap` is true (previous character was a space/hyphen).
     - Lowercase otherwise.
     - Update `next_cap` for the next character.
3. **Terminate**: Stop when all characters are processed.
4. **Rebuild the String**: Concatenate processed characters in order.

---

### **5. Handle Edge Cases**
- **Empty Strings**: Ensure no errors if `content_text` is empty.
- **Multiple Hyphens/Spaces**: Preserve them but reset capitalization appropriately.
- **Leading/Trailing Spaces/Hyphens**: Process them without altering original formatting.

---

### **6. Implement in SQL**
#### Key Steps in Code:
1. **Recursive CTE Setup**:
   - Anchor member processes the first character.
   - Recursive member processes subsequent characters.
2. **Capitalization Logic**:
   ```sql
   CASE 
     WHEN next_cap = 1 THEN UPPER(current_char)
     ELSE LOWER(current_char)
   END
   ```
3. **State Management**:
   - Update `next_cap` to `1` if the current character is a space or hyphen.

#### Final Code:
```sql
WITH RECURSIVE cte AS (
    SELECT 
        content_id,
        content_text,
        1 AS pos,
        UPPER(SUBSTRING(content_text, 1, 1)) AS converted_char,
        CASE WHEN SUBSTRING(content_text, 1, 1) IN (' ', '-') THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS next_cap
    FROM user_content
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 
        cte.content_id,
        cte.content_text,
        cte.pos + 1,
        CASE 
            WHEN cte.next_cap = 1 THEN UPPER(SUBSTRING(cte.content_text, cte.pos + 1, 1))
            ELSE LOWER(SUBSTRING(cte.content_text, cte.pos + 1, 1))
        END,
        CASE 
            WHEN SUBSTRING(cte.content_text, cte.pos + 1, 1) IN (' ', '-') THEN 1 
            ELSE 0 
        END
    FROM cte
    WHERE cte.pos < LENGTH(cte.content_text)
)
SELECT 
    content_id,
    content_text AS original_text,
    GROUP_CONCAT(converted_char ORDER BY pos SEPARATOR '') AS converted_text
FROM cte
GROUP BY content_id, content_text;
```

### **7. Test with Examples**
- **Input**: `the QUICK-brown fox`
- **Processing**:
  - `t` → `T` (capitalize first character).
  - `h` → `h` (lowercase, no trigger).
  - `e` → `e` → ... until space.
  - Space → ` `, set `next_cap=1`.
  - `Q` → `Q` (triggered by space), `next_cap=0`.
  - `U` → `u` (lowercase), and so on.
- **Output**: `The Quick-Brown Fox`.

---

### **8. Optimize and Refine**
- **Efficiency**: Recursive CTEs can be resource-heavy for long strings, but they’re necessary here.
- **Readability**: Use clear variable names (e.g., `next_cap`) and comments.

By methodically breaking down the problem, leveraging SQL’s recursive capabilities, and rigorously testing edge cases, you can systematically arrive at the correct solution.
