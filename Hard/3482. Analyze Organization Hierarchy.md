Table: Employees

+----------------+---------+
| Column Name    | Type    | 
+----------------+---------+
| employee_id    | int     |
| employee_name  | varchar |
| manager_id     | int     |
| salary         | int     |
| department     | varchar |
+----------------+----------+
employee_id is the unique key for this table.
Each row contains information about an employee, including their ID, name, their manager's ID, salary, and department.
manager_id is null for the top-level manager (CEO).

Write a solution to analyze the organizational hierarchy and answer the following:

    Hierarchy Levels: For each employee, determine their level in the organization (CEO is level 1, employees reporting directly to the CEO are level 2, and so on).
    Team Size: For each employee who is a manager, count the total number of employees under them (direct and indirect reports).
    Salary Budget: For each manager, calculate the total salary budget they control (sum of salaries of all employees under them, including indirect reports, plus their own salary).

Return the result table ordered by the result ordered by level in ascending order, then by budget in descending order, and finally by employee_name in ascending order.

The result format is in the following example.

Explanation:

    Organization Structure:
        Alice (ID: 1) is the CEO (level 1) with no manager
        Bob (ID: 2) and Charlie (ID: 3) report directly to Alice (level 2)
        David (ID: 4), Eva (ID: 5) report to Bob, while Frank (ID: 6) and Grace (ID: 7) report to Charlie (level 3)
        Hank (ID: 8) reports to David, and Ivy (ID: 9) and Judy (ID: 10) report to Frank (level 4)
    Level Calculation:
        The CEO (Alice) is at level 1
        Each subsequent level of management adds 1 to the level
    Team Size Calculation:
        Alice has 9 employees under her (the entire company except herself)
        Bob has 3 employees (David, Eva, and Hank)
        Charlie has 4 employees (Frank, Grace, Ivy, and Judy)
        David has 1 employee (Hank)
        Frank has 2 employees (Ivy and Judy)
        Eva, Grace, Hank, Ivy, and Judy have no direct reports (team_size = 0)
    Budget Calculation:
        Alice's budget: Her salary (12000) + all employees' salaries (72500) = 84500
        Charlie's budget: His salary (10000) + Frank's budget (23000) + Grace's salary (8500) = 41500
        Bob's budget: His salary (10000) + David's budget (13500) + Eva's salary (7500) = 31000
        Frank's budget: His salary (9000) + Ivy's salary (7000) + Judy's salary (7000) = 23000
        David's budget: His salary (7500) + Hank's salary (6000) = 13500
        Employees with no direct reports have budgets equal to their own salary

Note:

    The result is ordered first by level in ascending order
    Within the same level, employees are ordered by budget in descending order then by name in ascending order

# Solution Report

## Problem Understanding
We need to analyze an organizational hierarchy by:
1. Determining each employee's level (CEO is level 1, direct reports level 2, etc.)
2. Calculating team size for managers (total direct and indirect reports)
3. Calculating salary budget for managers (sum of all subordinate salaries including their own)
4. Ordering results by level (ascending), then budget (descending), then name (ascending)

## Approach
1. **Hierarchy Levels**: Use a recursive CTE to traverse the hierarchy and assign levels
2. **Team Size**: Count all employees in each manager's subtree
3. **Salary Budget**: Sum all salaries in each manager's subtree
4. **Ordering**: Implement the specified sorting criteria

## Solution Code
```sql
WITH RECURSIVE hierarchy AS (
    -- Base case: CEO with level 1
    SELECT 
        employee_id,
        employee_name,
        manager_id,
        salary,
        department,
        1 AS level
    FROM Employees
    WHERE manager_id IS NULL
    
    UNION ALL
    
    -- Recursive case: employees with their level
    SELECT 
        e.employee_id,
        e.employee_name,
        e.manager_id,
        e.salary,
        e.department,
        h.level + 1 AS level
    FROM Employees e
    JOIN hierarchy h ON e.manager_id = h.employee_id
),

team_sizes AS (
    SELECT 
        m.employee_id,
        COUNT(r.employee_id) AS team_size
    FROM Employees m
    LEFT JOIN Employees r ON r.manager_id = m.employee_id OR 
                           EXISTS (
                               SELECT 1 FROM Employees 
                               WHERE manager_id = m.employee_id 
                               AND employee_id = r.manager_id
                           )
    GROUP BY m.employee_id
),

salary_budgets AS (
    WITH RECURSIVE manager_tree AS (
        SELECT 
            employee_id,
            employee_id AS root_manager
        FROM Employees
        
        UNION ALL
        
        SELECT 
            e.employee_id,
            mt.root_manager
        FROM Employees e
        JOIN manager_tree mt ON e.manager_id = mt.employee_id
    )
    
    SELECT 
        root_manager AS employee_id,
        SUM(salary) AS budget
    FROM manager_tree mt
    JOIN Employees e ON mt.employee_id = e.employee_id
    GROUP BY root_manager
)

SELECT 
    h.employee_id,
    h.employee_name,
    h.level,
    COALESCE(ts.team_size, 0) AS team_size,
    COALESCE(sb.budget, h.salary) AS budget
FROM hierarchy h
LEFT JOIN team_sizes ts ON h.employee_id = ts.employee_id
LEFT JOIN salary_budgets sb ON h.employee_id = sb.employee_id
ORDER BY 
    h.level ASC,
    budget DESC,
    h.employee_name ASC;
```

## Explanation
1. **hierarchy CTE**: Recursively builds the organizational hierarchy with levels
   - Base case starts with the CEO (manager_id IS NULL)
   - Recursive case joins employees to their managers and increments level

2. **team_sizes CTE**: Calculates team sizes by counting all employees in each manager's subtree
   - Includes both direct and indirect reports through a recursive condition

3. **salary_budgets CTE**: Calculates salary budgets using a recursive CTE
   - Identifies all employees in each manager's subtree
   - Sums their salaries to get the total budget

4. **Final query**: Combines all information with proper:
   - COALESCE to handle non-managers (team_size = 0, budget = own salary)
   - ORDER BY to meet the specified sorting criteria

This solution efficiently handles the hierarchical data and complex aggregations while meeting all requirements.
