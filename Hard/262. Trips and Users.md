## 262. Trips and Users

Calculate the cancellation rate of taxi trips for each day between '2013-10-01' and '2013-10-03'. The cancellation rate is defined as the number of cancelled requests divided by the total number of requests, considering only trips made by unbanned users (both clients and drivers must not be banned).  Round the cancellation rate to two decimal places.

**Tables:**

### 1. `Trips` Table

This table holds information about taxi trips.

| Column Name | Type     | Description                                                                 |
| ----------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`        | `int`    | Primary key, unique identifier for each trip.                               |
| `client_id` | `int`    | Foreign key referencing `users_id` in the `Users` table, representing the client. |
| `driver_id` | `int`    | Foreign key referencing `users_id` in the `Users` table, representing the driver. |
| `city_id`   | `int`    | ID of the city where the trip took place.                                    |
| `status`    | `enum`   | Status of the trip: 'completed', 'cancelled_by_driver', 'cancelled_by_client'. |
| `request_at`| `varchar`| Date when the trip was requested (in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format).                    |

**Primary Key:** `id`

### 2. `Users` Table

This table contains information about users (clients and drivers).

| Column Name | Type     | Description                                         |
| ----------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `users_id`  | `int`    | Primary key, unique identifier for each user.       |
| `banned`    | `enum`   | Indicates if the user is banned: 'Yes' or 'No'.      |
| `role`      | `enum`   | Role of the user: 'client', 'driver', 'partner'. |

**Primary Key:** `users_id`

**Cancellation Rate Definition:**

The cancellation rate for a given day is calculated as:

```
Cancellation Rate = (Number of cancelled requests by unbanned users) / (Total number of requests by unbanned users)
```

**Constraints:**

*   Only consider trips where both the client and the driver are not banned.
*   Consider trips within the date range '2013-10-01' to '2013-10-03'.
*   Round the cancellation rate to two decimal places.
*   Return the result table in any order.

**Example Input:**

**`Trips` Table:**

| id  | client\_id | driver\_id | city\_id | status              | request\_at |
| --- | ---------- | ---------- | -------- | --------------------- | ----------- |
| 1   | 1          | 10         | 1        | completed           | 2013-10-01  |
| 2   | 2          | 11         | 1        | cancelled\_by\_driver | 2013-10-01  |

| 9   | 3          | 10         | 12       | completed           | 2013-10-03  |
| 10  | 4          | 13         | 12       | cancelled\_by\_driver | 2013-10-03  |

**`Users` Table:**

| users\_id | banned | role   |
| --------- | ------ | ------ |
| 1         | No     | client |
| 2         | Yes    | client |
| 3         | No     | client |
| 4         | No     | client |
| 10        | No     | driver |
| 11        | No     | driver |
| 12        | No     | driver |
| 13        | No     | driver |

**Expected Output:**

| Day        | Cancellation Rate |
| ---------- | ----------------- |
| 2013-10-01 | 0.33              |
| 2013-10-02 | 0.00              |
| 2013-10-03 | 0.50              |

**Explanation of Example Output:**

*   **2013-10-01:**
    *   Total requests initially: 4 (Ids: 1, 2, 3, 4)
    *   Requests by banned clients/drivers to be ignored: 1 (Id: 2, client\_id 2 is banned)
    *   Unbanned requests: 3 (Ids: 1, 3, 4)
    *   Cancelled unbanned requests: 1 (Id: 4, status 'cancelled\_by\_client')
    *   Cancellation Rate: 1 / 3 = 0.33
*   **2013-10-02:**
    *   Total requests initially: 3 (Ids: 5, 6, 7)
    *   Requests by banned clients/drivers to be ignored: 1 (Id: 6, client\_id 2 is banned)
    *   Unbanned requests: 2 (Ids: 5, 7)
    *   Cancelled unbanned requests: 0
    *   Cancellation Rate: 0 / 2 = 0.00
*   **2013-10-03:**
    *   Total requests initially: 3 (Ids: 8, 9, 10)
    *   Requests by banned clients/drivers to be ignored: 1 (Id: 8, client\_id 2 is banned)
    *   Unbanned requests: 2 (Ids: 9, 10)
    *   Cancelled unbanned requests: 1 (Id: 10, status 'cancelled\_by\_driver')
    *   Cancellation Rate: 1 / 2 = 0.50

## Understanding the Problem

We need to calculate the daily cancellation rate for taxi trips between October 1-3, 2013, considering only trips where neither the client nor driver was banned.

## Solution Structure

The provided solution is well-structured and handles all requirements:

```sql
SELECT
    request_at AS "Day",
    ROUND(SUM(status != 'completed')/COUNT(*), 2) AS "Cancellation Rate"
FROM
    Trips
WHERE
    client_id IN (SELECT users_id FROM Users WHERE banned = "No")
    AND driver_id IN (SELECT users_id FROM Users WHERE banned = "No")
    AND request_at BETWEEN "2013-10-01" AND "2013-10-03"
GROUP BY
    request_at
ORDER BY
    request_at ASC
```

## Key Components Explained

1. **Filtering Unbanned Users**:
   - Uses subqueries to ensure only trips with unbanned clients and drivers are included
   - `client_id IN (SELECT users_id FROM Users WHERE banned = "No")`
   - `driver_id IN (SELECT users_id FROM Users WHERE banned = "No")`

2. **Date Range Filter**:
   - `request_at BETWEEN "2013-10-01" AND "2013-10-03"` restricts to the specified 3-day period

3. **Cancellation Rate Calculation**:
   - `SUM(status != 'completed')` counts all non-completed trips (both types of cancellations)
   - Divides by total count of qualifying trips (`COUNT(*)`)
   - Rounds to 2 decimal places with `ROUND(..., 2)`

4. **Grouping and Ordering**:
   - Groups results by day with `GROUP BY request_at`
   - Orders chronologically with `ORDER BY request_at ASC`

## Alternative Approach

An alternative using JOINs might be more efficient with proper indexing:

```sql
SELECT
    t.request_at AS "Day",
    ROUND(SUM(t.status != 'completed')/COUNT(*), 2) AS "Cancellation Rate"
FROM
    Trips t
JOIN
    Users c ON t.client_id = c.users_id AND c.banned = 'No'
JOIN
    Users d ON t.driver_id = d.users_id AND d.banned = 'No'
WHERE
    t.request_at BETWEEN '2013-10-01' AND '2013-10-03'
GROUP BY
    t.request_at
ORDER BY
    t.request_at ASC
```

This JOIN version might perform better by avoiding repeated subquery executions.
