Table: Trips

+-------------+----------+
| Column Name | Type     |
+-------------+----------+
| id          | int      |
| client_id   | int      |
| driver_id   | int      |
| city_id     | int      |
| status      | enum     |
| request_at  | varchar  |     
+-------------+----------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
The table holds all taxi trips. Each trip has a unique id, while client_id and driver_id are foreign keys to the users_id at the Users table.
Status is an ENUM (category) type of ('completed', 'cancelled_by_driver', 'cancelled_by_client').

 

Table: Users

+-------------+----------+
| Column Name | Type     |
+-------------+----------+
| users_id    | int      |
| banned      | enum     |
| role        | enum     |
+-------------+----------+
users_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
The table holds all users. Each user has a unique users_id, and role is an ENUM type of ('client', 'driver', 'partner').
banned is an ENUM (category) type of ('Yes', 'No').

 

The cancellation rate is computed by dividing the number of canceled (by client or driver) requests with unbanned users by the total number of requests with unbanned users on that day.

Write a solution to find the cancellation rate of requests with unbanned users (both client and driver must not be banned) each day between "2013-10-01" and "2013-10-03" with at least one trip. Round Cancellation Rate to two decimal points.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

+------------+-------------------+
Explanation: 
On 2013-10-01:
  - There were 4 requests in total, 2 of which were canceled.
  - However, the request with Id=2 was made by a banned client (User_Id=2), so it is ignored in the calculation.
  - Hence there are 3 unbanned requests in total, 1 of which was canceled.
  - The Cancellation Rate is (1 / 3) = 0.33
On 2013-10-02:
  - There were 3 requests in total, 0 of which were canceled.
  - The request with Id=6 was made by a banned client, so it is ignored.
  - Hence there are 2 unbanned requests in total, 0 of which were canceled.
  - The Cancellation Rate is (0 / 2) = 0.00
On 2013-10-03:
  - There were 3 requests in total, 1 of which was canceled.
  - The request with Id=8 was made by a banned client, so it is ignored.
  - Hence there are 2 unbanned request in total, 1 of which were canceled.
  - The Cancellation Rate is (1 / 2) = 0.50

# SQL Query Analysis: Cancellation Rate Calculation

## Understanding the Problem

We need to calculate the daily cancellation rate for taxi trips between October 1-3, 2013, considering only trips where neither the client nor driver was banned.

## Solution Structure

The provided solution is well-structured and handles all requirements:

```sql
SELECT
    request_at AS "Day",
    ROUND(SUM(status != 'completed')/COUNT(*), 2) AS "Cancellation Rate"
FROM
    Trips
WHERE
    client_id IN (SELECT users_id FROM Users WHERE banned = "No")
    AND driver_id IN (SELECT users_id FROM Users WHERE banned = "No")
    AND request_at BETWEEN "2013-10-01" AND "2013-10-03"
GROUP BY
    request_at
ORDER BY
    request_at ASC
```

## Key Components Explained

1. **Filtering Unbanned Users**:
   - Uses subqueries to ensure only trips with unbanned clients and drivers are included
   - `client_id IN (SELECT users_id FROM Users WHERE banned = "No")`
   - `driver_id IN (SELECT users_id FROM Users WHERE banned = "No")`

2. **Date Range Filter**:
   - `request_at BETWEEN "2013-10-01" AND "2013-10-03"` restricts to the specified 3-day period

3. **Cancellation Rate Calculation**:
   - `SUM(status != 'completed')` counts all non-completed trips (both types of cancellations)
   - Divides by total count of qualifying trips (`COUNT(*)`)
   - Rounds to 2 decimal places with `ROUND(..., 2)`

4. **Grouping and Ordering**:
   - Groups results by day with `GROUP BY request_at`
   - Orders chronologically with `ORDER BY request_at ASC`

## Alternative Approach

An alternative using JOINs might be more efficient with proper indexing:

```sql
SELECT
    t.request_at AS "Day",
    ROUND(SUM(t.status != 'completed')/COUNT(*), 2) AS "Cancellation Rate"
FROM
    Trips t
JOIN
    Users c ON t.client_id = c.users_id AND c.banned = 'No'
JOIN
    Users d ON t.driver_id = d.users_id AND d.banned = 'No'
WHERE
    t.request_at BETWEEN '2013-10-01' AND '2013-10-03'
GROUP BY
    t.request_at
ORDER BY
    t.request_at ASC
```

This JOIN version might perform better by avoiding repeated subquery executions.
