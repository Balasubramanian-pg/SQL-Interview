## 601. Human Traffic of Stadium

Write a solution to display the records with three or more consecutive rows with increasing `id` values, and where the number of `people` is greater than or equal to 100 for each of these rows.

Return the result table ordered by `visit_date` in ascending order.

**Tables:**

### 1. `Stadium` Table

This table contains stadium visit information.

| Column Name   | Type    | Description                                                                                              |
| ----------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`            | `int`     | Unique identifier for each visit record, and it is sequentially increasing with `visit_date`.            |
| `visit_date`    | `date`    | Date of the stadium visit. Unique for each record.                                                    |
| `people`        | `int`     | Number of people who visited the stadium on the `visit_date`.                                          |

**Primary Key:** `visit_date` (unique values column)

**Constraints:**

*   Identify records that are part of a consecutive sequence of at least three rows based on `id`.
*   For each record in the consecutive sequence, the number of `people` must be 100 or greater.
*   Return the `id`, `visit_date`, and `people` for these records.
*   Order the result table by `visit_date` in ascending order.

**Example Input:**

**`Stadium` Table:**

| id  | visit\_date | people    |
| --- | ----------- | --------- |
| 1   | 2017-01-01  | 10        |
| 2   | 2017-01-02  | 109       |
| 3   | 2017-01-03  | 150       |
| 4   | 2017-01-04  | 99        |
| 5   | 2017-01-05  | 145       |
| 6   | 2017-01-06  | 1455      |
| 7   | 2017-01-07  | 199       |
| 8   | 2017-01-09  | 188       |

**Expected Output:**

| id  | visit\_date | people    |
| --- | ----------- | --------- |
| 5   | 2017-01-05  | 145       |
| 6   | 2017-01-06  | 1455      |
| 7   | 2017-01-07  | 199       |
| 8   | 2017-01-09  | 188       |

**Explanation of Example Output:**

1. The rows with IDs 5, 6, 7, and 8 form a consecutive sequence of IDs where each row has `people >= 100`. Although the `visit_date` for id 8 is not consecutive to id 7, the `id` values are consecutive in terms of finding the sequence. 
2. The rows with IDs 2 and 3 do not form a sequence of at least three consecutive IDs that meet the people count condition when considered with their preceding and succeeding rows (row 1 and row 4 break the sequence). Therefore, only rows 5, 6, 7, and 8 are included in the output. 
3. The output is ordered by *`visit_date`*.

## Understanding the Problem

We need to find records where:
1. There are at least 3 consecutive IDs (not necessarily consecutive dates)
2. Each record in the sequence has ≥100 people
3. Results should be ordered by visit_date

## Solution

```sql
WITH QualifiedRecords AS (
    SELECT *
    FROM Stadium
    WHERE people >= 100
),
ConsecutiveGroups AS (
    SELECT 
        id,
        visit_date,
        people,
        id - ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY id) AS grp
    FROM QualifiedRecords
)
SELECT 
    id,
    visit_date,
    people
FROM ConsecutiveGroups
WHERE grp IN (
    SELECT grp
    FROM ConsecutiveGroups
    GROUP BY grp
    HAVING COUNT(*) >= 3
)
ORDER BY visit_date;
```

## Explanation

1. **First CTE (QualifiedRecords)**:
   - Filters for records with ≥100 people attendance

2. **Second CTE (ConsecutiveGroups)**:
   - Uses the "difference of row numbers" technique to identify consecutive IDs
   - `id - ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY id)` creates a group identifier for consecutive sequences

3. **Main Query**:
   - Selects only groups with ≥3 consecutive records
   - Orders results by visit_date as required

## Example Walkthrough

In the sample data:
- IDs 2,3 (2 records) → excluded (need 3+)
- IDs 5,6,7,8 (4 consecutive records) → included
- Each has ≥100 people (145, 1455, 199, 188)

The query correctly returns IDs 5-8 as they form a sequence of 4 consecutive records all meeting the attendance threshold.

## Alternative Solution (Using Self-Joins)

For databases without window functions:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT s1.*
FROM Stadium s1, Stadium s2, Stadium s3
WHERE 
    s1.people >= 100 AND s2.people >= 100 AND s3.people >= 100
    AND (
        (s1.id = s2.id - 1 AND s1.id = s3.id - 2) OR  -- s1, s2, s3 consecutive
        (s1.id = s2.id + 1 AND s1.id = s3.id - 1) OR  -- s2, s1, s3 consecutive
        (s1.id = s2.id + 1 AND s1.id = s3.id + 2)    -- s3, s2, s1 consecutive
    )
ORDER BY s1.visit_date;
```

This uses self-joins to find all possible 3-record consecutive sequences.
