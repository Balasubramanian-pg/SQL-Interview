## 601. Human Traffic of Stadium

Write a solution to display the records with three or more consecutive rows with increasing `id` values, and where the number of `people` is greater than or equal to 100 for each of these rows.

Return the result table ordered by `visit_date` in ascending order.

**Tables:**

### 1. `Stadium` Table

This table contains stadium visit information.

| Column Name   | Type    | Description                                                                                              |
| ----------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`            | `int`     | Unique identifier for each visit record, and it is sequentially increasing with `visit_date`.            |
| `visit_date`    | `date`    | Date of the stadium visit. Unique for each record.                                                    |
| `people`        | `int`     | Number of people who visited the stadium on the `visit_date`.                                          |

**Primary Key:** `visit_date` (unique values column)

**Constraints:**

*   Identify records that are part of a consecutive sequence of at least three rows based on `id`.
*   For each record in the consecutive sequence, the number of `people` must be 100 or greater.
*   Return the `id`, `visit_date`, and `people` for these records.
*   Order the result table by `visit_date` in ascending order.

**Example Input:**

**`Stadium` Table:**

| id  | visit\_date | people    |
| --- | ----------- | --------- |
| 1   | 2017-01-01  | 10        |
| 2   | 2017-01-02  | 109       |
| 3   | 2017-01-03  | 150       |
| 4   | 2017-01-04  | 99        |
| 5   | 2017-01-05  | 145       |
| 6   | 2017-01-06  | 1455      |
| 7   | 2017-01-07  | 199       |
| 8   | 2017-01-09  | 188       |

**Expected Output:**

| id  | visit\_date | people    |
| --- | ----------- | --------- |
| 5   | 2017-01-05  | 145       |
| 6   | 2017-01-06  | 1455      |
| 7   | 2017-01-07  | 199       |
| 8   | 2017-01-09  | 188       |

**Explanation of Example Output:**

The rows with IDs 5, 6, 7, and 8 form a consecutive sequence of IDs where each row has `people >= 100`. Although the `visit_date` for id 8 is not consecutive to id 7, the `id` values are consecutive in terms of finding the sequence. The rows with IDs 2 and 3 do not form a sequence of at least three consecutive IDs that meet the people count condition when considered with their preceding and succeeding rows (row 1 and row 4 break the sequence). Therefore, only rows 5, 6, 7, and 8 are included in the output. The output is ordered by `visit_date`.
