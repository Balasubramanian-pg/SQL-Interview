## Problem: First Year of Sales for Each Product

Write a solution to select the `product_id`, `year` (as `first_year`), `quantity`, and `price` for the very first year each product was sold.

Return the resulting table in any order.

**Tables:**

### 1. `Sales` Table

This table contains sales information for products across different years.

| Column Name | Type  | Description                                                                 |
| ----------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sale_id`     | `int`   | Primary key (part 1), unique identifier for each sale.                      |
| `product_id`  | `int`   | Foreign key, identifier of the product sold, references `Product.product_id`. |
| `year`        | `int`   | Primary key (part 2), year of the sale.                                    |
| `quantity`    | `int`   | Quantity of the product sold in the sale.                                   |
| `price`       | `int`   | Price per unit of the product in the sale.                                  |

**Primary Key:** (`sale_id`, `year`)
**Foreign Key:** `product_id` references `Product.product_id`

### 2. `Product` Table

This table contains information about products.

| Column Name  | Type    | Description                                                                 |
| ----------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `product_id`   | `int`     | Primary key, unique identifier for each product.                            |
| `product_name` | `varchar` | Name of the product.                                                        |

**Primary Key:** `product_id`

**Constraints:**

*   For each `product_id`, find the minimum `year` in the `Sales` table where that product was sold.
*   Retrieve the `product_id`, the minimum `year` (as `first_year`), and the corresponding `quantity` and `price` from the `Sales` table for that first year.
*   Return the result table in any order.

**Example Input:**

**`Sales` Table:**

| sale\_id | product\_id | year | quantity | price |
| ------- | ----------- | ---- | -------- | ----- |
| 1     | 100         | 2008 | 10       | 5000  |
| 2     | 100         | 2009 | 12       | 5000  |
| 7     | 200         | 2011 | 15       | 9000  |

**`Product` Table:**

| product\_id | product\_name |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| 100       | Nokia         |
| 200       | Apple         |
| 300       | Samsung       |

**Expected Output:**

| product\_id | first\_year | quantity | price |
| ----------- | ----------- | -------- | ----- |
| 100       | 2008        | 10       | 5000  |
| 200       | 2011        | 15       | 9000  |

**Explanation of Example Output:**

*   **product\_id = 100 (Nokia):** Sold in years 2008 and 2009. The first year of sale is 2008. The record for the first year is (product\_id=100, year=2008, quantity=10, price=5000).
*   **product\_id = 200 (Apple):** Sold in year 2011. The first year of sale is 2011. The record for the first year is (product\_id=200, year=2011, quantity=15, price=9000).
*   **product\_id = 300 (Samsung):** Not sold in the `Sales` table.  Therefore, no output for this product.

The output table contains the `product_id`, the `first_year` of sale, and the `quantity` and `price` from the `Sales` record corresponding to the first year of sale for each product.

# Solution: First Year Sales for Each Product

## Approach
To find the first year each product was sold and its sales details:
1. For each product, identify the earliest year it appears in sales
2. Retrieve the complete sales record (quantity, price) for that first year
3. Exclude products that were never sold

## Solution
```sql
WITH FirstYearSales AS (
    SELECT 
        product_id,
        MIN(year) AS first_year
    FROM 
        Sales
    GROUP BY 
        product_id
)

SELECT 
    s.product_id,
    f.first_year,
    s.quantity,
    s.price
FROM 
    Sales s
JOIN 
    FirstYearSales f ON s.product_id = f.product_id AND s.year = f.first_year;
```

## Explanation
1. The CTE `FirstYearSales` finds the earliest sale year for each product
2. We then join back to the original Sales table to get the full details
3. The join condition ensures we only get records from the first year
4. Results include product_id, first_year, quantity, and price

## Alternative Approach
Using a subquery instead of CTE:
```sql
SELECT 
    s.product_id,
    s.year AS first_year,
    s.quantity,
    s.price
FROM 
    Sales s
WHERE 
    (s.product_id, s.year) IN (
        SELECT 
            product_id, 
            MIN(year)
        FROM 
            Sales
        GROUP BY 
            product_id
    );
```

**Key Differences**:
- The CTE version is often more readable for complex queries
- Both solutions correctly handle multiple sales in the first year
- Performance should be similar with proper indexing

**Performance Considerations**:
- An index on (product_id, year) would optimize both solutions
- The GROUP BY operation is the most computationally intensive part
- Both solutions efficiently find first-year sales without temporary tables
