## Question: Calculate Capital Gain/Loss for Each Stock

**Table Schemas:**

**Table: `Stocks`**

```markdown
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| stock_name    | varchar |
| operation     | enum    |
| operation_day | int     |
| price         | int     |
+---------------+---------+
```

*   `(stock_name, operation_day)` is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
*   The `operation` column is an ENUM (category) of type ('Sell', 'Buy').
*   Each row of this table indicates that the stock which has `stock_name` had an `operation` on the day `operation_day` with the given `price`.
*   It is guaranteed that each 'Sell' operation for a stock has a corresponding 'Buy' operation in a previous day.
*   It is also guaranteed that each 'Buy' operation for a stock has a corresponding 'Sell' operation in an upcoming day.

**Problem Statement:**

Write a solution to report the Capital gain/loss for each stock.

The Capital gain/loss of a stock is the total gain or loss after buying and selling the stock one or many times.

Return the result table in any order.

**Example 1:**

**Input:**

**`Stocks` table:**

```markdown
+---------------+-----------+---------------+--------+
| stock_name    | operation | operation_day | price  |
+---------------+-----------+---------------+--------+
| Leetcode      | Buy       | 1             | 1000   |
| Corona Masks  | Buy       | 2             | 10     |
| Leetcode      | Sell      | 5             | 9000   |
| Handbags      | Buy       | 17            | 30000  |
| Corona Masks  | Sell      | 3             | 1010   |
| Corona Masks  | Buy       | 4             | 1000   |
| Corona Masks  | Sell      | 5             | 500    |
| Corona Masks  | Buy       | 6             | 1000   |
| Handbags      | Sell      | 29            | 7000   |
| Corona Masks  | Sell      | 10            | 10000  |
+---------------+-----------+---------------+--------+
```

**Output:**

```markdown
+---------------+-------------------+
| stock_name    | capital_gain_loss |
+---------------+-------------------+
| Corona Masks  | 9500              |
| Leetcode      | 8000              |
| Handbags      | -23000            |
+---------------+-------------------+
```

**Explanation:**

*   **Leetcode** stock was bought at day 1 for 1000$ and was sold at day 5 for 9000$. Capital gain = 9000 - 1000 = 8000$.
*   **Handbags** stock was bought at day 17 for 30000$ and was sold at day 29 for 7000$. Capital loss = 7000 - 30000 = -23000$.
*   **Corona Masks** stock was bought at day 1 for 10$ and was sold at day 3 for 1010$. It was bought again at day 4 for 1000$ and was sold at day 5 for 500$. At last, it was bought at day 6 for 1000$ and was sold at day 10 for 10000$. Capital gain/loss is the sum of capital gains/losses for each ('Buy' --> 'Sell') operation = (1010 - 10) + (500 - 1000) + (10000 - 1000) = 1000 - 500 + 9000 = 9500$.

# SQL Solution for Calculating Capital Gain/Loss

To calculate the capital gain/loss for each stock, we need to sum the differences between sell prices and their corresponding buy prices for each stock.

```sql
SELECT 
    stock_name,
    SUM(CASE WHEN operation = 'Sell' THEN price ELSE -price END) AS capital_gain_loss
FROM 
    Stocks
GROUP BY 
    stock_name
ORDER BY 
    stock_name;
```

## Explanation:

1. **CASE Expression**: 
   - For each 'Sell' operation, we add the price (positive)
   - For each 'Buy' operation, we subtract the price (negative)

2. **SUM Aggregation**:
   - We sum these values for each stock, which effectively calculates:
     (Total Sell prices) - (Total Buy prices)

3. **GROUP BY**:
   - Groups the calculations by stock_name

4. **ORDER BY** (optional):
   - Sorts the results alphabetically by stock name

## Why This Works:
- Each 'Buy' must have a corresponding 'Sell' (per problem constraints)
- The sum naturally pairs each buy with its corresponding sell
- The result is the net gain/loss across all transactions for each stock

## Example Output:
For the given input, this produces:
```
+---------------+-------------------+
| stock_name    | capital_gain_loss |
+---------------+-------------------+
| Corona Masks  | 9500              |
| Handbags      | -23000            |
| Leetcode      | 8000              |
+---------------+-------------------+
```

This solution is efficient, simple, and handles all edge cases correctly.
