## Problem: User Order Count in 2019

Write a solution to find, for each user, their `join_date` and the number of orders they made as a buyer in 2019.

Return the result table in any order.

**Tables:**

### 1. `Users` Table

This table contains information about users of an online shopping website.

| Column Name    | Type    | Description                                                                 |
| ----------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `user_id`        | `int`     | Primary key, unique identifier for each user.                               |
| `join_date`      | `date`    | Date when the user joined the website.                                      |
| `favorite_brand` | `varchar` | User's favorite brand of items.                                            |

### 2. `Orders` Table

This table contains information about orders placed on the website.

| Column Name   | Type    | Description                                                                 |
| ----------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `order_id`      | `int`     | Primary key, unique identifier for each order.                              |
| `order_date`    | `date`    | Date when the order was placed.                                             |
| `item_id`       | `int`     | Foreign key referencing `item_id` in the `Items` table.                    |

### 3. `Items` Table

This table contains information about items sold on the website.

| Column Name   | Type    | Description                                                                 |
| ----------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| `item_brand`    | `varchar` | Brand of the item.                                                          |

**Primary Key:** `item_id`

**Constraints:**

*   For each user in the `Users` table, find their `join_date`.
*   Count the number of orders placed by each user as a buyer in the year 2019 from the `Orders` table.
*   Return a table with `buyer_id` (aliased as `buyer_id`), `join_date`, and `orders_in_2019` (the order count).
*   The result table can be in any order.

**Example Input:**

**`Users` Table:**

| user\_id | join\_date  | favorite\_brand |
| ----------- | ----------- | --------------- |
| 1         | 2018-01-01  | Lenovo        |
| 2         | 2018-02-09  | Samsung       |
| 3         | 2018-01-19  | LG            |
| 4         | 2018-05-21  | HP            |

**`Orders` Table:**

| order\_id | order\_date | item\_id | buyer\_id | seller\_id |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------- | --------- | --------- |
| 1         | 2019-08-01  | 4       | 1         | 2         |
| 2         | 2018-08-02  | 2       | 1         | 3         |
| 3         | 2019-08-03  | 3       | 2         | 3         |
| 4         | 2018-08-04  | 1       | 4         | 2         |
| 5         | 2018-08-04  | 1       | 3         | 4         |
| 6         | 2019-08-05  | 2       | 2         | 4         |

**`Items` Table:**

| item\_id | item\_brand |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 1         | Samsung     |
| 2         | Lenovo      |
| 3         | LG          |
| 4         | HP          |

**Expected Output:**

| buyer\_id | join\_date  | orders\_in\_2019 |
| ----------- | ----------- | ---------------- |
| 1         | 2018-01-01  | 1                |
| 2         | 2018-02-09  | 2                |
| 3         | 2018-01-19  | 0                |
| 4         | 2018-05-21  | 0                |

**Explanation of Example Output:**

*   **User 1 (user\_id=1):** `join_date` is '2018-01-01'. In 2019, they placed 1 order (order\_id=1).
*   **User 2 (user\_id=2):** `join_date` is '2018-02-09'. In 2019, they placed 2 orders (order\_id=3 and order\_id=6).
*   **User 3 (user\_id=3):** `join_date` is '2018-01-19'. In 2019, they placed 0 orders.
*   **User 4 (user\_id=4):** `join_date` is '2018-05-21'. In 2019, they placed 0 orders.

The output table shows the `buyer_id`, `join_date`, and the count of orders placed in 2019 for each user.


# Solution: User Join Dates and 2019 Order Counts

## Approach
To find each user's join date and their 2019 order count as a buyer:
1. Left join Users with Orders to preserve all users
2. Filter orders from 2019 and match buyer_id with user_id
3. Count orders per user (including zeros)
4. Return user_id (as buyer_id), join_date, and order count

## Solution
```sql
SELECT 
    u.user_id AS buyer_id,
    u.join_date,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN YEAR(o.order_date) = 2019 THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) AS orders_in_2019
FROM 
    Users u
LEFT JOIN 
    Orders o ON u.user_id = o.buyer_id AND YEAR(o.order_date) = 2019
GROUP BY 
    u.user_id, u.join_date
ORDER BY 
    u.user_id;
```

## Explanation
1. `LEFT JOIN` ensures all users are included, even with no orders
2. `YEAR(o.order_date) = 2019` filters for 2019 orders in the join condition
3. `COUNT(CASE WHEN...)` counts only 2019 orders while preserving users with zero orders
4. Results are grouped by user and ordered by user_id

## Alternative Approach
Using a subquery for counting:
```sql
SELECT 
    u.user_id AS buyer_id,
    u.join_date,
    IFNULL((
        SELECT COUNT(*) 
        FROM Orders o 
        WHERE o.buyer_id = u.user_id AND YEAR(o.order_date) = 2019
    ), 0) AS orders_in_2019
FROM 
    Users u
ORDER BY 
    u.user_id;
```

**Key Differences**:
- The first solution performs better with large datasets
- The subquery version is more readable but may be less efficient
- Both correctly handle users with zero orders

**Performance Considerations**:
- An index on Orders(buyer_id, order_date) would optimize both solutions
- The LEFT JOIN version scans tables only once
- The CASE expression avoids counting non-2019 orders
