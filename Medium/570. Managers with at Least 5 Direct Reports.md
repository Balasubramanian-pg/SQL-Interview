## 570. Managers with at Least 5 Direct Reports all managers who have at least five direct reports.

**Tables:**

### 1. `Employee` Table

This table contains information about employees and their managers.

| Column Name | Type    | Description                                                                 |
| ----------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`          | `int`     | Primary key, unique identifier for each employee.                           |
| `name`        | `varchar` | Name of the employee.                                                     |
| `department`  | `varchar` | Department the employee belongs to.                                       |
| `managerId`   | `int`     | ID of the employee's manager.  `NULL` if the employee has no manager. |

**Primary Key:** `id`

**Constraints:**

*   A manager is identified by being referenced in the `managerId` column of other employees.
*   We need to find managers who have 5 or more employees reporting directly to them.
*   No employee is their own manager.

**Example Input:**

**`Employee` Table:**

| id  | name  | department | managerId |
| --- | ----- | ---------- | --------- |
| 101 | John  | A          | null      |
| 102 | Dan   | A          | 101       |
| 103 | James | A          | 101       |
| 104 | Amy   | A          | 101       |
| 105 | Anne  | A          | 101       |
| 106 | Ron   | B          | 101       |

**Expected Output:**

| name |
| ---- |
| John |

**Explanation of Example Output:**

*   **John (id=101):** Has 5 direct reports: Dan (102), James (103), Amy (104), Anne (105), and Ron (106). Therefore, John is a manager with at least five direct reports.
*   **Dan (id=102), James (id=103), Amy (id=104), Anne (id=105), Ron (id=106):** These employees have managers (or no manager in the case of John), but they are not managers themselves based on the input data (no other employee reports to them).

Thus, only John is identified as a manager with at least five direct reports.

## Understanding the Problem

Imagine you have a company's employee list showing:
- Each employee's ID and name
- Their department
- The ID of their manager (boss)

We need to find **which managers have 5 or more employees reporting directly to them**.

## Real-World Analogy

Think of this like a school:
- Teachers are "managers"
- Students are "employees" who report to a teacher
- We want to find which teachers have 5 or more students in their class

## Step-by-Step Solution Approach

1. **Count how many employees each manager has**:
   - For every manager ID, count how many times it appears in the `managerId` column
   - This count tells us how many people report to that manager

2. **Filter for managers with 5+ employees**:
   - Only keep managers where this count is 5 or more

3. **Get the manager names**:
   - Once we have the manager IDs with 5+ reports, look up their names

## The SQL Solution Broken Down

```sql
-- Step 1: Find manager IDs with 5+ direct reports
SELECT managerId
FROM Employee
WHERE managerId IS NOT NULL  -- Ignore employees without managers
GROUP BY managerId           -- Group counts by manager
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 5         -- Only keep managers with 5+ counts

-- Step 2: Join with Employee table to get names
SELECT e.name
FROM Employee e
JOIN (
    -- This is our Step 1 query embedded here
    SELECT managerId
    FROM Employee
    WHERE managerId IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY managerId
    HAVING COUNT(*) >= 5
) managers ON e.id = managers.managerId;
```

## Why This Works

- `GROUP BY managerId` - Makes one group per manager
- `COUNT(*)` - Counts employees in each manager's group
- `HAVING COUNT(*) >= 5` - Only keeps manager groups with 5+ employees
- The join connects these manager IDs back to their names

## Example Walkthrough

Using the sample data:
- Manager ID 101 appears 5 times (employees 102-106 report to them)
- No other manager ID appears 5+ times
- So we return just "John" (ID 101) as the result

This approach efficiently finds busy managers using simple counting and filtering!
