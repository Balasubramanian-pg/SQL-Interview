#### Question: Find User with Most Ratings and Movie with Highest Average Rating in February 2020

**Table Schemas:**

**Table: `Movies`**

```markdown
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| movie_id      | int     |
| title         | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
```

*   `movie_id` is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
*   `title` is the name of the movie.

**Table: `Users`**

```markdown
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| user_id       | int     |
| name          | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
```

*   `user_id` is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
*   The column `'name'` has unique values.

**Table: `MovieRating`**

```markdown
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| movie_id      | int     |
| user_id       | int     |
| rating        | int     |
| created_at    | date    |
+---------------+---------+
```

*   `(movie_id, user_id)` is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
*   This table contains the rating of a movie by a user in their review.
*   `created_at` is the user's review date.

**Problem Statement:**

Write a solution to:

1.  **Find the name of the user who has rated the greatest number of movies.** In case of a tie, return the lexicographically smaller user name.
2.  **Find the movie name with the highest average rating in February 2020.** In case of a tie, return the lexicographically smaller movie name.

The result table should be in the following format.

**Example 1:**

**Input:**

**`Movies` table:**

```markdown
+-------------+--------------+
| movie_id    |  title       |
+-------------+--------------+
| 1           | Avengers     |
| 2           | Frozen 2     |
| 3           | Joker        |
+-------------+--------------+
```

**`Users` table:**

```markdown
+-------------+--------------+
| user_id     |  name        |
+-------------+--------------+
| 1           | Daniel       |
| 2           | Monica       |
| 3           | Maria        |
| 4           | James        |
+-------------+--------------+
```

**`MovieRating` table:**

```markdown
+-------------+--------------+--------------+-------------+
| movie_id    | user_id      | rating       | created_at  |
+-------------+--------------+--------------+-------------+
| 1           | 1            | 3            | 2020-01-12  |
| 1           | 2            | 4            | 2020-02-11  |
| 1           | 3            | 2            | 2020-02-12  |
| 1           | 4            | 1            | 2020-01-01  |
| 2           | 1            | 5            | 2020-02-17  |
| 2           | 2            | 2            | 2020-02-01  |
| 2           | 3            | 2            | 2020-03-01  |
| 3           | 1            | 3            | 2020-02-22  |
| 3           | 2            | 4            | 2020-02-25  |
+-------------+--------------+--------------+-------------+
```

**Output:**

```markdown
+--------------+
| results      |
+--------------+
| Daniel       |
| Frozen 2     |
+--------------+
```

**Explanation:**

*   Daniel and Monica have rated 3 movies ("Avengers", "Frozen 2" and "Joker") but Daniel is smaller lexicographically.
*   Frozen 2 and Joker have a rating average of 3.5 in February but Frozen 2 is smaller lexicographically.

# SQL Solution for Movie Rating Analysis

Here's a solution that combines both requirements into one query:

```sql
(SELECT name AS results
 FROM Users
 JOIN (
     SELECT user_id, COUNT(*) AS rating_count
     FROM MovieRating
     GROUP BY user_id
     ORDER BY rating_count DESC, name ASC
     LIMIT 1
 ) AS top_user ON Users.user_id = top_user.user_id)

UNION ALL

(SELECT title AS results
 FROM Movies
 JOIN (
     SELECT movie_id, AVG(rating) AS avg_rating
     FROM MovieRating
     WHERE created_at BETWEEN '2020-02-01' AND '2020-02-29'
     GROUP BY movie_id
     ORDER BY avg_rating DESC, title ASC
     LIMIT 1
 ) AS top_movie ON Movies.movie_id = top_movie.movie_id);
```

## Explanation:

### Part 1: Finding the user with most ratings
1. Count ratings per user from MovieRating table
2. Join with Users table to get names
3. Order by rating count (descending) and name (ascending for tie-breaker)
4. Limit to 1 result

### Part 2: Finding the highest-rated movie in February 2020
1. Filter MovieRating for February 2020 dates
2. Calculate average rating per movie
3. Join with Movies table to get titles
4. Order by average rating (descending) and title (ascending for tie-breaker)
5. Limit to 1 result

### Combined Solution:
- The two queries are combined with UNION ALL to produce the final output
- Each subquery returns exactly one row with the required result
- The output matches the example format with two rows

This solution handles all requirements:
- Finds the most active reviewer (with tie-breaker)
- Finds the highest-rated February movie (with tie-breaker)
- Returns results in the specified format
- Is efficient with proper use of LIMIT and ORDER BY
