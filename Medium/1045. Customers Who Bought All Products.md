# 1045. Customers Who Bought All Products

## Problem: Customers Who Bought All Products

Write a solution to report the `customer_id`s from the `Customer` table that have bought all the products listed in the `Product` table.

Return the result table in any order.

**Tables:**

### 1. `Customer` Table

This table records which products were bought by which customers. It may contain duplicate rows if a customer buys the same product multiple times (though for this problem, the number of times a product is bought by a customer is irrelevant, we only care if they bought it at least once).

| Column Name | Type    | Description                                                                 |
| ----------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `customer_id` | `int`     | ID of the customer who bought the product. Not `NULL`.                       |
| `product_key` | `int`     | Foreign key referencing `product_key` in the `Product` table.               |

**Foreign Key:** `product_key` references `Product.product_key`
**Note:** This table may contain duplicate rows.

### 2. `Product` Table

This table lists all available products by their unique `product_key`.

| Column Name | Type    | Description                                                                 |
| ----------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `product_key` | `int`     | Primary key, unique identifier for each product.                            |

**Primary Key:** `product_key`

**Constraints:**

*   Identify customers who have entries in the `Customer` table for *every* `product_key` that exists in the `Product` table.
*   Return a table with a single column, `customer_id`, containing the IDs of these customers.
*   The result table can be in any order.

**Example Input:**

**`Customer` Table:**

| customer\_id | product\_key |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 1         | 5         |
| 2         | 6         |
| 3         | 5         |
| 3         | 6         |
| 1         | 6         |

**`Product` Table:**

| product\_key |
| ----------- |
| 5         |
| 6         |

**Expected Output:**

| customer\_id |
| ----------- |
| 1         |
| 3         |

**Explanation of Example Output:**

*   **Customer 1 (customer\_id=1):** Bought product\_key 5 and product\_key 6. Since the `Product` table contains product\_key 5 and 6, customer 1 bought all products. Included.
*   **Customer 2 (customer\_id=2):** Bought only product\_key 6. Customer 2 did not buy product\_key 5, which is in the `Product` table. Excluded.
*   **Customer 3 (customer\_id=3):** Bought product\_key 5 and product\_key 6. Since the `Product` table contains product\_key 5 and 6, customer 3 bought all products. Included.

Therefore, customers with `customer_id` 1 and 3 are the ones who bought all products.

# Solution: Customers Who Bought All Products

## Approach
To find customers who purchased all products, we need to:
1. Count the distinct products each customer bought
2. Compare this count with the total number of available products
3. Return customers whose purchase count matches the product count

## Solution
```sql
SELECT customer_id
FROM Customer
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT product_key) = (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Product);
```

## Explanation
1. `GROUP BY customer_id` groups purchases by each customer
2. `COUNT(DISTINCT product_key)` counts unique products each customer bought
3. `HAVING` compares this count with the total product count from the Product table
4. Only customers who bought all products (count matches) are returned

## Alternative Approach
Using JOIN and GROUP BY with a subquery:
```sql
SELECT c.customer_id
FROM Customer c
JOIN Product p ON c.product_key = p.product_key
GROUP BY c.customer_id
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT c.product_key) = (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Product);
```

**Key Differences**:
- The first solution is more concise
- Both handle duplicate purchases correctly with DISTINCT
- Performance should be similar with proper indexing

**Performance Considerations**:
- Index on product_key would help the JOIN version
- The GROUP BY operation is the most computationally intensive part
- Both solutions require scanning the Customer table once
