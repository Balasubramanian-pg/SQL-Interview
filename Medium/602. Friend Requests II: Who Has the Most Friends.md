# 602. Friend Requests II: Who Has the Most Friends
#### Problem: People with the Most Friends

Find the people who have the most friends and the number of friends they have. The test cases guarantee that only one person has the most friends.

**Tables:**

### 1. `RequestAccepted` Table

This table records accepted friend requests.

| Column Name    | Type    | Description                                                                                              |
| ----------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `requester_id`   | `int`     | Primary key (part 1), ID of the user who sent the friend request.                                         |
| `accepter_id`    | `int`     | Primary key (part 2), ID of the user who accepted the friend request.                                       |
| `accept_date`    | `date`    | Date when the friend request was accepted.                                                                 |

**Primary Key:** (`requester_id`, `accepter_id`)

**Constraints:**

*   Determine the person who has the largest number of friends based on the `RequestAccepted` table.
*   Friendship is mutual: if (A, B) is in `RequestAccepted`, then A is a friend of B and B is a friend of A.
*   Return the `id` of the person with the most friends and their friend count (`num`).
*   It is guaranteed that only one person will have the most friends.

**Example Input:**

**`RequestAccepted` Table:**

| requester\_id | accepter\_id | accept\_date |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 1         | 2         | 2016/06/03  |
| 1         | 3         | 2016/06/08  |
| 2         | 3         | 2016/06/08  |
| 3         | 4         | 2016/06/09  |

**Expected Output:**

| id  | num |
| --- | --- |
| 3   | 3   |

**Explanation of Example Output:**

*   **Person 1:** Has friends 2 and 3 (2 friends).
*   **Person 2:** Has friends 1 and 3 (2 friends).
*   **Person 3:** Has friends 1, 2, and 4 (3 friends).
*   **Person 4:** Has friend 3 (1 friend).

Person 3 has the most friends (3). Therefore, the output is `id = 3` and `num = 3`.

**Follow-up:**

In the real world, multiple people could have the same most number of friends. Could you find all these people in this case?

## Understanding the Problem

We need to:
1. Treat friendships as mutual (A→B means A and B are friends)
2. Count each person's total number of friends
3. Find the person(s) with the highest friend count

## Solution (Single Top Person)

```sql
WITH FriendCounts AS (
    SELECT id, COUNT(*) AS num
    FROM (
        SELECT requester_id AS id FROM RequestAccepted
        UNION ALL
        SELECT accepter_id AS id FROM RequestAccepted
    ) AllFriends
    GROUP BY id
)
SELECT id, num
FROM FriendCounts
ORDER BY num DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

## Explanation

1. **Combine Both Directions**:
   - Use `UNION ALL` to combine both requester and accepter IDs
   - This treats friendships as mutual relationships

2. **Count Friends**:
   - Group by user ID and count occurrences
   - Each occurrence represents one friendship

3. **Find Top Person**:
   - Order by friend count descending
   - Take just the top result with `LIMIT 1`

## Follow-up Solution (Handling Ties)

For cases where multiple people might tie for most friends:

```sql
WITH FriendCounts AS (
    SELECT id, COUNT(*) AS num
    FROM (
        SELECT requester_id AS id FROM RequestAccepted
        UNION ALL
        SELECT accepter_id AS id FROM RequestAccepted
    ) AllFriends
    GROUP BY id
),
MaxCount AS (
    SELECT MAX(num) AS max_num FROM FriendCounts
)
SELECT id, num
FROM FriendCounts
WHERE num = (SELECT max_num FROM MaxCount)
ORDER BY id;
```

## Example Walkthrough

Using the sample data:
- Person 1 appears as requester twice → 2 friends
- Person 2 appears as requester once and accepter once → 2 friends
- Person 3 appears as requester once and accepter twice → 3 friends
- Person 4 appears as accepter once → 1 friend

The query correctly identifies person 3 with 3 friends as the top result.

## Key Points

- `UNION ALL` combines both sides of the friendship relationship
- The first solution assumes exactly one top result
- The follow-up solution handles multiple people with the same max friend count
- Counting is done after combining both directions to properly count mutual friendships
