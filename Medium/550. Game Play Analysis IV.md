## 550. Game Play Analysis IV

Report the fraction of players that logged in again on the day after the day they first logged in, rounded to 2 decimal places. In other words, count the number of players that logged in for at least two consecutive days starting from their first login date, then divide that number by the total number of players.

**Tables:**

### 1. `Activity` Table

This table shows the activity of players of some games.

| Column Name  | Type    | Description                                                                                             |
| ----------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `player_id`    | `int`     | Primary key (part 1), unique identifier for each player.                                                  |
| `device_id`    | `int`     | The ID of the device used by the player for the activity.                                                |
| `event_date`   | `date`    | Primary key (part 2), the date when the player logged in and played games.                                |
| `games_played` | `int`     | The number of games played by the player on the `event_date` using the `device_id`. Can be 0 if they just logged in. |

**Primary Key:** (`player_id`, `event_date`)

**Constraints:**

*   Calculate the fraction of players who logged in on the day after their first login date.
*   Round the fraction to 2 decimal places.

**Example Input:**

**`Activity` Table:**

| player\_id | device\_id | event\_date | games\_played |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-01  | 5           |
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-02  | 6           |
| 2         | 3         | 2017-06-25  | 1           |
| 3         | 1         | 2016-03-02  | 0           |
| 3         | 4         | 2018-07-03  | 5           |

**Expected Output:**

| fraction  |
| ----------- |
| 0.33      |

**Explanation of Example Output:**

*   **Player 1:** First login date is '2016-03-01'. They logged in again on '2016-03-02', which is the day after their first login.
*   **Player 2:** First login date is '2017-06-25'. They did not log in on '2017-06-26'.
*   **Player 3:** First login date is '2016-03-02'.  Although they have another login on '2018-07-03', we are interested in the day *after* their *first* login, which is '2016-03-03'. They did not log in on '2016-03-03'.

Only player 1 logged back in the day after their first login. There are a total of 3 players (1, 2, 3). Therefore, the fraction is 1/3 = 0.33.

## Understanding the Problem

We need to calculate the fraction of players who logged in on the day immediately after their first login date. This requires:
1. Identifying each player's first login date
2. Checking if they logged in again the next day
3. Calculating the ratio of such players to all players

## Solution

```sql
WITH FirstLogins AS (
    SELECT 
        player_id,
        MIN(event_date) AS first_login
    FROM 
        Activity
    GROUP BY 
        player_id
),

ConsecutiveLogins AS (
    SELECT 
        COUNT(DISTINCT a.player_id) AS consecutive_players
    FROM 
        Activity a
    JOIN 
        FirstLogins fl ON a.player_id = fl.player_id
    WHERE 
        DATEDIFF(a.event_date, fl.first_login) = 1
)

SELECT 
    ROUND(
        (SELECT consecutive_players FROM ConsecutiveLogins) / 
        (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT player_id) FROM Activity),
        2
    ) AS fraction;
```

## Explanation

1. **FirstLogins CTE**:
   - Identifies each player's first login date using `MIN(event_date)`
   - Groups by `player_id` to get one row per player

2. **ConsecutiveLogins CTE**:
   - Joins the Activity table with FirstLogins
   - Counts distinct players who have a login exactly 1 day after their first login (`DATEDIFF = 1`)

3. **Final Calculation**:
   - Divides the count of players with consecutive logins by the total number of distinct players
   - Rounds the result to 2 decimal places with `ROUND(..., 2)`

## Alternative Approach (Single Query)

For databases that support it, you could also use:

```sql
SELECT 
    ROUND(
        COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN DATEDIFF(event_date, first_login) = 1 THEN player_id END) / 
        COUNT(DISTINCT player_id),
        2
    ) AS fraction
FROM (
    SELECT 
        player_id,
        event_date,
        MIN(event_date) OVER (PARTITION BY player_id) AS first_login
    FROM 
        Activity
) t;
```

This uses window functions to avoid the CTEs but may be less readable. The first solution is more widely compatible with different SQL dialects.
