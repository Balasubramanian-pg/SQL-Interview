## Problem: Node Type in Tree

Write a solution to report the type of each node in the tree. Each node can be one of three types: "Leaf", "Root", or "Inner".

**Tables:**

### 1. `Tree` Table

This table contains information about nodes and their parent nodes in a tree structure.

| Column Name | Type | Description                                                                 |
| ----------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`          | `int`  | Unique identifier for each node in the tree.                               |
| `p_id`        | `int`  | ID of the parent node for the current node. `NULL` for the root node.      |

**Primary Key:** `id`

**Node Type Definitions:**

*   **"Leaf"**: A node is a "Leaf" if it is not a root node and it does not have any child nodes.
*   **"Root"**: A node is a "Root" if its `p_id` is `NULL`. A tree will have only one root.
*   **"Inner"**: A node is "Inner" if it is neither a "Leaf" nor a "Root". This means it has a parent and at least one child.

**Constraints:**

*   The given structure is always a valid tree.
*   Each node will be classified into one of the three types: "Leaf", "Root", or "Inner".
*   Return the result table in any order.

**Example Input 1:**

**`Tree` Table:**

| id  | p\_id |
| --- | ----- |
| 1   | null  |
| 2   | 1     |
| 3   | 1     |
| 4   | 2     |
| 5   | 2     |

**Expected Output 1:**

| id  | type  |
| --- | ----- |
| 1   | Root  |
| 2   | Inner |
| 3   | Leaf  |
| 4   | Leaf  |
| 5   | Leaf  |

**Explanation of Example Output 1:**

*   **Node 1 (id=1):** `p_id` is `NULL`, so it is the "Root".
*   **Node 2 (id=2):** `p_id` is 1 (has a parent), and it is a parent to nodes 4 and 5 (has children), so it is "Inner".
*   **Node 3 (id=3):** `p_id` is 1 (has a parent), and it is not a parent to any other node (no children - not listed as a `p_id` for any other node), so it is "Leaf".
*   **Node 4 (id=4):** `p_id` is 2 (has a parent), and it is not a parent to any other node (no children), so it is "Leaf".
*   **Node 5 (id=5):** `p_id` is 2 (has a parent), and it is not a parent to any other node (no children), so it is "Leaf".

**Example Input 2:**

**`Tree` Table:**

| id  | p\_id |
| --- | ----- |
| 1   | null  |

**Expected Output 2:**

| id  | type  |
| --- | ----- |
| 1   | Root  |

**Explanation of Example Output 2:**

*   **Node 1 (id=1):** `p_id` is `NULL`, so it is the "Root". Even if it's the only node, it's still considered the root.

**Note:** This question is the same as 3054: Binary Tree Nodes.

To solve this problem, we need to categorize each node in the tree as either "Root", "Inner", or "Leaf" based on its relationship with other nodes. Hereâ€™s the step-by-step solution:

---

### **1. Procedural Decomposition of the Solution**

1. **Identify the Root Node**:  
   - The root node is the one with `p_id` as `NULL` (or no parent).

2. **Identify Leaf Nodes**:  
   - Leaf nodes are those that do not have any child nodes.  
   - We can find these by checking which nodes do not appear in the `p_id` column of any other row.

3. **Identify Inner Nodes**:  
   - Inner nodes are those that have both a parent and at least one child.  
   - These nodes will appear in both the `id` column (as children) and the `p_id` column (as parents).

4. **Combine Results**:  
   - Categorize each node based on the above conditions and return the result.

To determine the type of each node in the tree, I'll need to:
1. Identify the root node (where p_id is NULL)
2. Identify inner nodes (nodes that are parents to other nodes)
3. All remaining nodes are leaves

Here's the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    id,
    CASE 
        WHEN p_id IS NULL THEN 'Root'
        WHEN id IN (SELECT DISTINCT p_id FROM Tree WHERE p_id IS NOT NULL) THEN 'Inner'
        ELSE 'Leaf'
    END AS type
FROM Tree
ORDER BY id;
```

## Explanation:

1. The CASE statement evaluates each node's type:
   - If `p_id` is NULL, it's the "Root"
   - If the node's ID appears in any other node's `p_id` (and it's not NULL), it's an "Inner" node
   - Otherwise, it's a "Leaf" node

2. The subquery `(SELECT DISTINCT p_id FROM Tree WHERE p_id IS NOT NULL)` finds all nodes that are parents of other nodes (excluding NULL values)

3. We order the results by `id` for consistent output (though the problem allows any order)

This approach efficiently classifies each node into one of the three categories based on its position in the tree structure.
