## Problem: Swap Seats of Consecutive Students

Write a solution to swap the seat `id` of every two consecutive students in the `Seat` table. If the number of students is odd, the seat of the last student should remain unchanged.

Return the result table ordered by `id` in ascending order.

**Tables:**

### 1. `Seat` Table

This table contains information about student seats.

| Column Name | Type    | Description                                                                 |
| ----------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`          | `int`     | Primary key, unique identifier for each seat and student. ID sequence starts from 1 and increments continuously. |
| `student`     | `varchar` | Name of the student occupying the seat.                                     |

**Primary Key:** `id`

**Constraints:**

*   Swap the `student` names for every pair of consecutive `id`s (1 and 2, 3 and 4, and so on).
*   If the total number of students is odd, the student in the last seat (highest `id`) should not be swapped.
*   Return the table with swapped student names, ordered by `id` in ascending order.

**Example Input:**

**`Seat` Table:**

| id  | student |
| --- | ------- |
| 1   | Abbot   |
| 2   | Doris   |
| 3   | Emerson |
| 4   | Green   |
| 5   | Jeames  |

**Expected Output:**

| id  | student |
| --- | ------- |
| 1   | Doris   |
| 2   | Abbot   |
| 3   | Green   |
| 4   | Emerson |
| 5   | Jeames  |

**Explanation of Example Output:**

*   **Seats 1 and 2:** Students "Abbot" and "Doris" are swapped.
*   **Seats 3 and 4:** Students "Emerson" and "Green" are swapped.
*   **Seat 5:** Since there are 5 students (an odd number), the student "Jeames" in the last seat (id=5) is not swapped.

The resulting table shows the swapped seats, ordered by `id`.

# Solution: Swapping Consecutive Students' Seats

## Procedural Decomposition

1. **Identify Pairing Logic**: Determine how to pair consecutive seats (1↔2, 3↔4, etc.)
2. **Handle Odd Count**: Preserve the last student's position when total count is odd
3. **Implement Swapping**: Create logic to exchange student names between paired seats
4. **Maintain Order**: Ensure final results are ordered by seat id

## Approach

1. **Case-Based Swapping**: Use CASE statement to handle different swapping scenarios
2. **Odd/Even Detection**: Check if id is odd or even to determine swap behavior
3. **Join Alternative**: Alternatively use self-join to pair consecutive seats
4. **Edge Handling**: Special handling for the last odd-numbered seat

## Solution

```sql
SELECT 
    id,
    CASE 
        WHEN id % 2 = 1 AND id = (SELECT MAX(id) FROM Seat) THEN student
        WHEN id % 2 = 1 THEN (SELECT student FROM Seat WHERE id = s.id + 1)
        ELSE (SELECT student FROM Seat WHERE id = s.id - 1)
    END AS student
FROM Seat s
ORDER BY id;
```

**Explanation**:
- For odd IDs (except last): Get student from next seat (id+1)
- For even IDs: Get student from previous seat (id-1)
- For last odd ID: Keep original student
- Results ordered by id to maintain seat sequence

## Alternative Approach (Using Self-Join)

```sql
SELECT 
    s1.id,
    COALESCE(s2.student, s1.student) AS student
FROM Seat s1
LEFT JOIN Seat s2 ON 
    (s1.id % 2 = 1 AND s2.id = s1.id + 1) OR
    (s1.id % 2 = 0 AND s2.id = s1.id - 1)
ORDER BY s1.id;
```

**Key Differences**:
- Self-join version may be more readable
- COALESCE handles the last odd seat automatically
- Both approaches correctly handle the swapping logic

## Performance Considerations

1. **Index Utilization**: Primary key on id ensures efficient lookups
2. **Subquery Impact**: Correlated subqueries may impact performance on large tables
3. **Join Alternative**: Self-join might perform better with proper indexing
4. **Execution Plans**: Both solutions should have similar performance for moderate table sizes
