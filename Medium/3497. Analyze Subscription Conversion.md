# 3497. Analyze Subscription Conversion

## Problem Statement

A subscription service wants to analyze user behavior patterns. The company offers a 7-day free trial, after which users can subscribe to a paid plan or cancel. The goal is to:

1. Find users who converted from a free trial to a paid subscription.
2. Calculate each user's average daily activity duration during their free trial period (rounded to 2 decimal places).
3. Calculate each user's average daily activity duration during their paid subscription period (rounded to 2 decimal places).

The result should be a table ordered by `user_id` in ascending order.

## Example

### Input

**UserActivity Table:**

| user_id | activity_date | activity_type | activity_duration |
|---------|---------------|---------------|-------------------|

| 3       | 2023-03-15    | paid          | 55                |
| 3       | 2023-03-20    | paid          | 85                |
| 4       | 2023-04-01    | free_trial    | 40                |
| 4       | 2023-04-03    | free_trial    | 35                |
| 4       | 2023-04-05    | paid          | 45                |
| 4       | 2023-04-07    | cancelled     | 0                 |

### Output

| user_id | trial_avg_duration | paid_avg_duration |
|---------|--------------------|-------------------|
| 1       | 45.00              | 76.67             |
| 3       | 70.00              | 63.33             |
| 4       | 37.50              | 45.00             |

## Explanation

- **User 1:**
  - Free trial average duration: (45 + 30 + 60) / 3 = 45.00 minutes.
  - Paid subscription average duration: (75 + 90 + 65) / 3 = 76.67 minutes.

- **User 2:**
  - Free trial average duration: (55 + 25 + 50) / 3 = 43.33 minutes.
  - Did not convert to a paid subscription (only had `free_trial` and `cancelled` activities).
  - Not included in the output.

- **User 3:**
  - Free trial average duration: (70 + 60 + 80) / 3 = 70.00 minutes.
  - Paid subscription average duration: (50 + 55 + 85) / 3 = 63.33 minutes.

- **User 4:**
  - Free trial average duration: (40 + 35) / 2 = 37.50 minutes.
  - Paid subscription average duration: 45.00 minutes.

## Solution

### SQL Query

```sql
WITH converting_users AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT user_id
    FROM UserActivity
    WHERE activity_type = 'paid'
    AND user_id IN (
        SELECT DISTINCT user_id
        FROM UserActivity
        WHERE activity_type = 'free_trial'
    )
),

trial_avg AS (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        ROUND(AVG(activity_duration), 2) AS trial_avg_duration
    FROM UserActivity
    WHERE activity_type = 'free_trial'
    GROUP BY user_id
),

paid_avg AS (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        ROUND(AVG(activity_duration), 2) AS paid_avg_duration
    FROM UserActivity
    WHERE activity_type = 'paid'
    GROUP BY user_id
)

SELECT
    c.user_id,
    t.trial_avg_duration,
    p.paid_avg_duration
FROM
    converting_users c
JOIN
    trial_avg t ON c.user_id = t.user_id
JOIN
    paid_avg p ON c.user_id = p.user_id
ORDER BY
    c.user_id ASC;
```

### Explanation

1. **converting_users CTE:** Identifies users who have both `free_trial` and `paid` activities.
2. **trial_avg CTE:** Calculates the average duration for `free_trial` activities per user.
3. **paid_avg CTE:** Calculates the average duration for `paid` activities per user.
4. **Final Query:** Joins these CTEs to produce the required output, ordered by `user_id`.

This solution efficiently analyzes user behavior patterns while meeting all specified requirements.
