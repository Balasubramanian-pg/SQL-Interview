## 585. Investments in 2016

Report the sum of all total investment values in 2016 (`tiv_2016`), for all policyholders who meet the following two conditions:

1.  Have the same `tiv_2015` value as at least one other policyholder.
2.  Are not located in the same city as any other policyholder (i.e., the combination of `lat` and `lon` must be unique).

Round the result `tiv_2016` to two decimal places.

**Tables:**

### 1. `Insurance` Table

This table contains information about insurance policies.

| Column Name | Type    | Description                                                                    |
| ----------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `pid`         | `int`     | Primary key, unique identifier for each policy.                               |
| `tiv_2015`    | `float`   | Total investment value in 2015.                                               |
| `tiv_2016`    | `float`   | Total investment value in 2016.                                               |
| `lat`         | `float`   | Latitude of the policyholder's city. Guaranteed to be not `NULL`.             |
| `lon`         | `float`   | Longitude of the policyholder's city. Guaranteed to be not `NULL`.            |

**Primary Key:** `pid`

**Constraints:**

*   Identify policyholders based on two criteria: shared `tiv_2015` and unique location (`lat`, `lon`).
*   Calculate the sum of `tiv_2016` for the identified policyholders.
*   Round the final sum of `tiv_2016` to two decimal places.

**Example Input:**

**`Insurance` Table:**

| pid | tiv\_2015 | tiv\_2016 | lat | lon |
| --- | --------- | --------- | --- | --- |
| 1   | 10        | 5         | 10  | 10  |
| 2   | 20        | 20        | 20  | 20  |
| 3   | 10        | 30        | 20  | 20  |
| 4   | 10        | 40        | 40  | 40  |

**Expected Output:**

| tiv\_2016 |
| --------- |
| 45.00     |

**Explanation of Example Output:**

*   **Policyholder 1 (pid=1):**
    *   `tiv_2015` is 10, which is shared with policyholders 3 and 4. (Condition 1 met)
    *   Location (`lat=10`, `lon=10`) is unique. (Condition 2 met)
    *   Included in the sum.
*   **Policyholder 2 (pid=2):**
    *   `tiv_2015` is 20, which is not shared with any other policyholder. (Condition 1 not met)
    *   Location (`lat=20`, `lon=20`) is shared with policyholder 3. (Condition 2 not met)
    *   Excluded from the sum.
*   **Policyholder 3 (pid=3):**
    *   `tiv_2015` is 10, which is shared with policyholders 1 and 4. (Condition 1 met)
    *   Location (`lat=20`, `lon=20`) is shared with policyholder 2. (Condition 2 not met)
    *   Excluded from the sum.
*   **Policyholder 4 (pid=4):**
    *   `tiv_2015` is 10, which is shared with policyholders 1 and 3. (Condition 1 met)
    *   Location (`lat=40`, `lon=40`) is unique. (Condition 2 met)
    *   Included in the sum.

The sum of `tiv_2016` for policyholders 1 and 4 is 5 + 40 = 45.00.

## Understanding the Problem

We need to calculate the sum of 2016 investments (tiv_2016) for policyholders who meet two conditions:
1. **Shared 2015 Investment**: Their tiv_2015 matches at least one other policyholder
2. **Unique Location**: Their (lat, lon) combination is unique (no other policyholder shares the same city)

## Solution

```sql
SELECT ROUND(SUM(tiv_2016), 2) AS tiv_2016
FROM Insurance
WHERE tiv_2015 IN (
    SELECT tiv_2015
    FROM Insurance
    GROUP BY tiv_2015
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
)
AND (lat, lon) IN (
    SELECT lat, lon
    FROM Insurance
    GROUP BY lat, lon
    HAVING COUNT(*) = 1
);
```

## Explanation

1. **Finding Shared 2015 Investments**:
   - The subquery groups by tiv_2015 and counts occurrences
   - `HAVING COUNT(*) > 1` ensures we only keep values that appear more than once

2. **Finding Unique Locations**:
   - The subquery groups by (lat, lon) pairs
   - `HAVING COUNT(*) = 1` ensures we only keep unique location pairs

3. **Combining Conditions**:
   - The main query selects policies that meet both criteria
   - We sum their tiv_2016 values and round to 2 decimal places

## Example Walkthrough

Using the sample data:
- Policy 1: tiv_2015=10 (shared), location (10,10) unique → included
- Policy 2: tiv_2015=20 (unique) → excluded
- Policy 3: tiv_2015=10 (shared), location (20,20) not unique → excluded
- Policy 4: tiv_2015=10 (shared), location (40,40) unique → included

Sum of included tiv_2016 values: 5 (policy 1) + 40 (policy 4) = 45.00

## Alternative Solution (Using CTEs)

For better readability:

```sql
WITH SharedTiv2015 AS (
    SELECT tiv_2015
    FROM Insurance
    GROUP BY tiv_2015
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
),
UniqueLocations AS (
    SELECT lat, lon
    FROM Insurance
    GROUP BY lat, lon
    HAVING COUNT(*) = 1
)
SELECT ROUND(SUM(i.tiv_2016), 2) AS tiv_2016
FROM Insurance i
JOIN SharedTiv2015 s ON i.tiv_2015 = s.tiv_2015
JOIN UniqueLocations u ON i.lat = u.lat AND i.lon = u.lon;
```

This produces the same result but may be clearer for complex queries.
