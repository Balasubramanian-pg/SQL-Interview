# 178. Rank Scores

## Problem Statement

The goal is to rank the scores in the `Scores` table according to the following rules:

1. The scores should be ranked from the highest to the lowest.
2. If there is a tie between two scores, both should have the same ranking.
3. After a tie, the next ranking number should be the next consecutive integer value, with no gaps in the ranking.

The result should be a table ordered by `score` in descending order.

## Example

### Input

**Scores Table:**

| id | score |
|----|-------|
| 1  | 3.50  |
| 2  | 3.65  |
| 3  | 4.00  |
| 4  | 3.85  |
| 5  | 4.00  |
| 6  | 3.65  |

### Output

| score | rank |
|-------|------|
| 4.00  | 1    |
| 4.00  | 1    |
| 3.85  | 2    |
| 3.65  | 3    |
| 3.65  | 3    |
| 3.50  | 4    |

## Solution

### SQL Query

```sql
SELECT
    score,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY score DESC) AS rank
FROM
    Scores
ORDER BY
    score DESC;
```

### Explanation

1. **DENSE_RANK():** This window function assigns ranks to scores, with ties receiving the same rank. The next rank after a tie is the next consecutive integer.
2. **ORDER BY score DESC:** Ensures that the scores are ordered from highest to lowest.

This solution efficiently ranks the scores according to the specified rules.
