# 180. Consecutive Numbers

## Problem Statement

The goal is to find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively in the `Logs` table.

## Example

### Input

**Logs Table:**

| id | num |
|----|-----|
| 1  | 1   |
| 2  | 1   |
| 3  | 1   |
| 4  | 2   |
| 5  | 1   |
| 6  | 2   |
| 7  | 2   |

### Output

| ConsecutiveNums |
|-----------------|
| 1               |

### Explanation

- The number `1` appears consecutively three times.
- The number `2` does not appear consecutively three times.

## Solution

### SQL Query

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT
    num AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM (
    SELECT
        num,
        id,
        LEAD(num, 1) OVER (ORDER BY id) AS next_num,
        LEAD(num, 2) OVER (ORDER BY id) AS next_next_num
    FROM
        Logs
) subquery
WHERE
    num = next_num
    AND num = next_next_num;
```

### Explanation

1. **Subquery:**
   - Uses the `LEAD` window function to access the next two rows for each row.
   - `LEAD(num, 1)` gets the value of `num` in the next row.
   - `LEAD(num, 2)` gets the value of `num` in the row after the next row.

2. **Main Query:**
   - Filters the results to find rows where the current `num` is equal to the next two consecutive numbers.
   - Uses `DISTINCT` to ensure each number appears only once in the result.

This solution efficiently finds all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.
