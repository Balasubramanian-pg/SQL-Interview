# 3421. Find Students Who Improved

## Problem Statement

The goal is to identify students who have shown improvement in their exam scores. A student is considered to have shown improvement if they meet both of the following conditions:

1. Have taken exams in the same subject on at least two different dates.
2. Their latest score in that subject is higher than their first score.

The result should be a table ordered by `student_id` and `subject` in ascending order, including the `first_score` and `latest_score`.

## Example

### Input

**Scores Table:**

| student_id | subject | score | exam_date  |
|------------|---------|-------|------------|
| 101        | Math    | 70    | 2023-01-15 |
| 101        | Math    | 85    | 2023-02-15 |
| 101        | Physics | 65    | 2023-01-15 |
| 101        | Physics | 60    | 2023-02-15 |
| 102        | Math    | 80    | 2023-01-15 |
| 102        | Math    | 85    | 2023-02-15 |
| 103        | Math    | 90    | 2023-01-15 |
| 104        | Physics | 75    | 2023-01-15 |
| 104        | Physics | 85    | 2023-02-15 |

### Output

| student_id | subject | first_score | latest_score |
|------------|---------|-------------|--------------|
| 101        | Math    | 70          | 85           |
| 102        | Math    | 80          | 85           |
| 104        | Physics | 75          | 85           |

## Explanation

- **Student 101 in Math:** Improved from 70 to 85.
- **Student 101 in Physics:** No improvement (dropped from 65 to 60).
- **Student 102 in Math:** Improved from 80 to 85.
- **Student 103 in Math:** Only one exam, not eligible.
- **Student 104 in Physics:** Improved from 75 to 85.

## Solution

### SQL Query

```sql
WITH ranked_scores AS (
    SELECT
        student_id,
        subject,
        score,
        exam_date,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY student_id, subject ORDER BY exam_date) AS rn_first,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY student_id, subject ORDER BY exam_date DESC) AS rn_last
    FROM
        Scores
)
SELECT
    rs1.student_id,
    rs1.subject,
    rs1.score AS first_score,
    rs2.score AS latest_score
FROM
    ranked_scores rs1
JOIN
    ranked_scores rs2
ON
    rs1.student_id = rs2.student_id
    AND rs1.subject = rs2.subject
WHERE
    rs1.rn_first = 1
    AND rs2.rn_last = 1
    AND rs2.score > rs1.score
ORDER BY
    rs1.student_id,
    rs1.subject;
```

### Explanation

1. **ranked_scores CTE:** Assigns row numbers to each exam record for a student in a subject, ordered by `exam_date` in both ascending and descending order.
2. **Main Query:**
   - Joins the `ranked_scores` CTE with itself to compare the first and latest scores.
   - Filters for students whose latest score is higher than their first score.
   - Selects `student_id`, `subject`, `first_score`, and `latest_score` for students who meet the improvement criteria.

This solution efficiently identifies students who have shown improvement in their exam scores and includes their first and latest scores.
