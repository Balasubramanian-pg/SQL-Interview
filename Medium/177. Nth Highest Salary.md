# 177. Nth Highest Salary

## Problem Statement

The goal is to find the nth highest distinct salary from the `Employee` table. If there are fewer than n distinct salaries, return `null`.

## Example

### Example 1

**Input:**

**Employee Table:**

| id | salary |
|----|--------|
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |

**n = 2**

**Output:**

| getNthHighestSalary(2) |
|------------------------|
| 200                    |

### Example 2

**Input:**

**Employee Table:**

| id | salary |
|----|--------|
| 1  | 100    |

**n = 2**

**Output:**

| getNthHighestSalary(2) |
|------------------------|
| null                   |

## Solution

### SQL Query

```sql
SELECT
    DISTINCT salary
FROM
    Employee
ORDER BY
    salary DESC
LIMIT 1 OFFSET n - 1;
```

### Explanation

1. **DISTINCT:** Ensures that only unique salary values are considered.
2. **ORDER BY salary DESC:** Orders the salaries in descending order.
3. **LIMIT 1 OFFSET n - 1:** Skips the first `n-1` salaries and returns the nth highest salary. If there are fewer than `n` distinct salaries, this will return `null`.

This solution efficiently finds the nth highest distinct salary from the `Employee` table.
