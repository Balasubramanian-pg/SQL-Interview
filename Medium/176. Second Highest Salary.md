# 176. Second Highest Salary

## Problem Statement

The goal is to find the second highest distinct salary from the `Employee` table. If there is no second highest salary, return `null`.

## Example

### Example 1

**Input:**

**Employee Table:**

| id | salary |
|----|--------|
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |

**Output:**

| SecondHighestSalary |
|---------------------|
| 200                 |

### Example 2

**Input:**

**Employee Table:**

| id | salary |
|----|--------|
| 1  | 100    |

**Output:**

| SecondHighestSalary |
|---------------------|
| null                |

## Solution

### SQL Query

```sql
SELECT
    MAX(salary) AS SecondHighestSalary
FROM
    Employee
WHERE
    salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM Employee);
```

### Explanation

1. **Subquery:** Finds the maximum salary in the `Employee` table.
2. **Main Query:** Selects the maximum salary that is less than the maximum salary found in the subquery.
3. **Edge Case:** If there is only one distinct salary or no salaries, the query will return `null`.

This solution efficiently finds the second highest distinct salary from the `Employee` table.
