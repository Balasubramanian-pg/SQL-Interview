# TikTok User Confirmation Analysis

## Question Structure

**Tables:**
1. `emails` table:
   - `email_id` (integer): Unique identifier for each email
   - `user_id` (integer): Unique identifier for each user
   - `signup_date` (datetime): Date and time when user signed up

2. `texts` table:
   - `text_id` (integer): Unique identifier for each text message
   - `email_id` (integer): Foreign key linking to emails table
   - `signup_action` (string): Either 'Confirmed' or 'Not confirmed'
   - `action_date` (datetime): Date and time when user took the confirmation action

**Task:**
Write a SQL query to find user IDs who:
1. Did NOT confirm their sign-up on the first day (signup_date)
2. But DID confirm on the second day (the day after signup_date)

## Solution

```sql
SELECT e.user_id
FROM emails e
JOIN texts t ON e.email_id = t.email_id
WHERE t.signup_action = 'Confirmed'
  AND DATE(t.action_date) = DATE(e.signup_date) + INTERVAL '1 day'
  AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM texts t2
    WHERE t2.email_id = e.email_id
      AND t2.signup_action = 'Confirmed'
      AND DATE(t2.action_date) = DATE(e.signup_date)
  );
```

## Explanation

1. We join the `emails` and `texts` tables on `email_id` to connect user information with their confirmation actions
2. We filter for only confirmed actions (`signup_action = 'Confirmed'`)
3. We check that the confirmation happened exactly one day after signup (`DATE(t.action_date) = DATE(e.signup_date) + INTERVAL '1 day'`)
4. The `NOT EXISTS` subquery ensures there was no confirmation on the actual signup day
5. The query returns only the `user_id` as requested

In the example provided, user 1052 is returned because:
- They signed up on 07/09/2022
- They did not confirm on 07/09/2022 (only had a "Not confirmed" action)
- They confirmed on 07/10/2022 (the next day)
