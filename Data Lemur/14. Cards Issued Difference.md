### JPMorgan Chase Credit Card Issuance Analysis

**Scenario:**

Your team at JPMorgan Chase is preparing to launch a new credit card. To gain insights into issuance patterns, you need to analyze historical data on the number of cards issued each month for existing credit card products.

**Objective:**

Write an SQL query to determine the difference between the highest and lowest number of cards issued in a single month for *each* credit card product.

**Input Table:**

You are provided with a table named `monthly_cards_issued`.

**Table Schema:** `monthly_cards_issued`

| Column Name   | Type    | Description                              |
|---------------|---------|------------------------------------------|
| card_name     | string  | The name of the credit card.             |
| issued_amount | integer | The number of cards issued in that month. |
| issue_month   | integer | The month of issuance (1-12).            |
| issue_year    | integer | The year of issuance.                    |

**Example Input:** `monthly_cards_issued`

| card_name              | issued_amount | issue_month | issue_year |
|------------------------|---------------|-------------|------------|
| Chase Freedom Flex     | 55000         | 1           | 2021       |
| Chase Freedom Flex     | 60000         | 2           | 2021       |
| Chase Freedom Flex     | 65000         | 3           | 2021       |
| Chase Freedom Flex     | 70000         | 4           | 2021       |
| Chase Sapphire Reserve | 170000        | 1           | 2021       |
| Chase Sapphire Reserve | 175000        | 2           | 2021       |
| Chase Sapphire Reserve | 180000        | 3           | 2021       |

**Desired Output:**

The query should output two columns:
1.  `card_name`: The name of the credit card.
2.  `difference`: The calculated difference between the maximum `issued_amount` and the minimum `issued_amount` for that card across all recorded months.

The results should be ordered by the `difference` in descending order (from the largest difference to the smallest).

**Example Output:**

| card_name              | difference |
|------------------------|------------|
| Chase Freedom Flex     | 15000      |
| Chase Sapphire Reserve | 10000      |

**Explanation of Example Output:**

*   **Chase Freedom Flex:** Max issuance = 70,000, Min issuance = 55,000. Difference = 70,000 - 55,000 = 15,000.
*   **Chase Sapphire Reserve:** Max issuance = 180,000, Min issuance = 170,000. Difference = 180,000 - 170,000 = 10,000.
*   The results are ordered with 15,000 (larger difference) appearing before 10,000.

**Task:**

Write the SQL query to achieve this result.

**SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT
    card_name,
    MAX(issued_amount) - MIN(issued_amount) AS difference
FROM
    monthly_cards_issued
GROUP BY
    card_name
ORDER BY
    difference DESC;
```
