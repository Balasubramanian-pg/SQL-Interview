To solve this problem, we need to create a histogram of tweets posted per user in the year 2022. The histogram should show the number of users who posted a specific number of tweets, grouped by the count of tweets (tweet bucket).

### Approach
1. **Filter Tweets by Year**: First, we filter the tweets to include only those posted in the year 2022. This ensures we consider the correct timeframe for our analysis.
2. **Count Tweets per User**: Next, we count how many tweets each user posted in 2022. This is done by grouping the data by `user_id` and counting the number of tweets for each user.
3. **Group Users by Tweet Count**: Finally, we group the results by the number of tweets (tweet count) to determine how many users fall into each tweet bucket. This gives us the histogram showing the distribution of users based on their tweet activity.

### Solution Code
```sql
SELECT 
    tweet_count AS tweet_bucket,
    COUNT(user_id) AS users_num
FROM (
    SELECT 
        user_id, 
        COUNT(tweet_id) AS tweet_count
    FROM tweets
    WHERE tweet_date >= '2022-01-01' 
      AND tweet_date < '2023-01-01'
    GROUP BY user_id
) AS user_tweet_counts
GROUP BY tweet_count
ORDER BY tweet_bucket;
```
### Solution 2

```sql
WITH count_tweets AS
(SELECT user_id AS user, COUNT(tweet_id) AS number
FROM tweets
WHERE EXTRACT(year FROM tweet_date) = '2022'
GROUP BY user_id)

SELECT number AS tweet_bucket,
      COUNT(user) AS users_num
FROM count_tweets
GROUP BY number;
```

### Explanation
1. **Filtering Tweets by Year**: The `WHERE` clause in the subquery ensures we only consider tweets from the year 2022. Using `tweet_date >= '2022-01-01' AND tweet_date < '2023-01-01'` captures all tweets from the start of 2022 to the end of the year, inclusive.
2. **Counting Tweets per User**: The subquery groups the data by `user_id` and counts the number of tweets for each user using `COUNT(tweet_id)`. This gives us a list of users along with the number of tweets they posted in 2022.
3. **Creating the Histogram**: The outer query groups the results by `tweet_count` (renamed as `tweet_bucket`) and counts the number of users in each group using `COUNT(user_id)`. This results in the histogram where each row represents a tweet bucket and the number of users in that bucket.

This approach efficiently processes the data to provide the required histogram, ensuring accurate counts and proper handling of the date range.
