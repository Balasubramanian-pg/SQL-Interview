**Question:**

You are given a table named `candidates` with two columns: `candidate_id` (integer) and `skill` (varchar). The table contains a list of candidates and their respective skills. Your task is to write a SQL query to find the `candidate_id` of candidates who possess all the following skills: Python, Tableau, and PostgreSQL. The output should be sorted by `candidate_id` in ascending order.

**candidates Table:**

| Column Name   | Type    |
|---------------|---------|
| candidate\_id | integer |
| skill         | varchar |

**Example Input:**

| candidate\_id | skill      |
|---------------|------------|
| 123           | Python     |
| 123           | Tableau    |
| 123           | PostgreSQL |
| 234           | R          |
| 234           | PowerBI    |
| 234           | SQL Server |
| 345           | Python     |
| 345           | Tableau    |

**Expected Output:**

| candidate\_id |
|---------------|
| 123           |

**Answer:**

```sql
SELECT candidate_id
FROM candidates
WHERE skill IN ('Python', 'Tableau', 'PostgreSQL')
GROUP BY candidate_id
HAVING COUNT(skill) = 3
ORDER BY candidate_id;
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`SELECT candidate_id`**: This specifies that we want to retrieve the `candidate_id`.
2.  **`FROM candidates`**: This indicates that we are querying the `candidates` table.
3.  **`WHERE skill IN ('Python', 'Tableau', 'PostgreSQL')`**: This filters the rows to include only those where the `skill` is one of the required skills (Python, Tableau, or PostgreSQL).
4.  **`GROUP BY candidate_id`**: This groups the rows based on the `candidate_id`, so we can count the number of required skills each candidate possesses.
5.  **`HAVING COUNT(skill) = 3`**: This filters the grouped results, keeping only those candidates for whom the count of required skills is exactly 3. This ensures that the candidate has all three required skills.
6.  **`ORDER BY candidate_id`**: This sorts the final output by `candidate_id` in ascending order as requested.
