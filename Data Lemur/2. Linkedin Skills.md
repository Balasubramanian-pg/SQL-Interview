**Question:**

You are given a table named `candidates` with two columns: `candidate_id` (integer) and `skill` (varchar). The table contains a list of candidates and their respective skills. Your task is to write a SQL query to find the `candidate_id` of candidates who possess all the following skills: Python, Tableau, and PostgreSQL. The output should be sorted by `candidate_id` in ascending order.

**candidates Table:**

| Column Name   | Type    |
|---------------|---------|
| candidate\_id | integer |
| skill         | varchar |

**Example Input:**

| candidate\_id | skill      |
|---------------|------------|
| 123           | Python     |
| 123           | Tableau    |
| 123           | PostgreSQL |
| 234           | R          |
| 234           | PowerBI    |
| 234           | SQL Server |
| 345           | Python     |
| 345           | Tableau    |

**Expected Output:**

| candidate\_id |
|---------------|
| 123           |

**Answer:**

```sql
SELECT candidate_id
FROM candidates
WHERE skill IN ('Python', 'Tableau', 'PostgreSQL')
GROUP BY candidate_id
HAVING COUNT(skill) = 3
ORDER BY candidate_id;
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`SELECT candidate_id`**: This specifies that we want to retrieve the `candidate_id`.
2.  **`FROM candidates`**: This indicates that we are querying the `candidates` table.
3.  **`WHERE skill IN ('Python', 'Tableau', 'PostgreSQL')`**: This filters the rows to include only those where the `skill` is one of the required skills (Python, Tableau, or PostgreSQL).
4.  **`GROUP BY candidate_id`**: This groups the rows based on the `candidate_id`, so we can count the number of required skills each candidate possesses.
5.  **`HAVING COUNT(skill) = 3`**: This filters the grouped results, keeping only those candidates for whom the count of required skills is exactly 3. This ensures that the candidate has all three required skills.
6.  **`ORDER BY candidate_id`**: This sorts the final output by `candidate_id` in ascending order as requested.

Okay, let's delve into some more aspects related to this SQL problem and solution:

**1. Alternative Solutions (Using Different SQL Constructs):**

While the provided solution using `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` with `COUNT()` is a common and efficient way to solve this, here are a couple of alternative approaches you could consider, although they might be less straightforward or efficient in some cases:

**a) Using Self-Joins:**

You could potentially use self-joins to find candidates who have each of the required skills. This involves joining the `candidates` table with itself multiple times.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT c1.candidate_id
FROM candidates c1
JOIN candidates c2 ON c1.candidate_id = c2.candidate_id AND c2.skill = 'Tableau'
JOIN candidates c3 ON c1.candidate_id = c3.candidate_id AND c3.skill = 'PostgreSQL'
WHERE c1.skill = 'Python'
ORDER BY c1.candidate_id;
```

* **Explanation:**
    * We join the `candidates` table three times, aliasing them as `c1`, `c2`, and `c3`.
    * The join conditions ensure that for each `candidate_id`, we find a row where the skill is 'Python' (`c1`), another where the skill is 'Tableau' (`c2`), and a third where the skill is 'PostgreSQL' (`c3`).
    * `DISTINCT` is used to ensure that each `candidate_id` is listed only once.
    * The `WHERE` clause in this specific example focuses the initial `c1` on 'Python', but the joins ensure the other skills are present for the same `candidate_id`.

* **Considerations:** This approach can become cumbersome and less readable if the number of required skills increases. It might also have performance implications depending on the database and the size of the table.

**b) Using Subqueries with `EXISTS`:**

You could use subqueries with the `EXISTS` operator to check if a candidate has each of the required skills.

```sql
SELECT c.candidate_id
FROM candidates c
WHERE c.skill = 'Python'
  AND EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM candidates c2 WHERE c2.candidate_id = c.candidate_id AND c2.skill = 'Tableau')
  AND EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM candidates c3 WHERE c3.candidate_id = c.candidate_id AND c3.skill = 'PostgreSQL')
GROUP BY c.candidate_id
ORDER BY c.candidate_id;
```

* **Explanation:**
    * The outer query selects `candidate_id` from the `candidates` table where the skill is 'Python'.
    * The `EXISTS` operator checks if a subquery returns any rows.
    * The first subquery checks if there's another row for the same `candidate_id` with the skill 'Tableau'.
    * The second subquery checks for the skill 'PostgreSQL'.
    * We still need `GROUP BY` to handle potential duplicate 'Python' entries for the same candidate (although the problem statement assumes no duplicates in the `candidates` table, it's good practice to consider).

* **Considerations:** This approach can be more readable for some people as it explicitly checks for the existence of each required skill for a given candidate.

**2. Edge Cases and Considerations:**

* **Case Sensitivity:** The query assumes that the skill names ('Python', 'Tableau', 'PostgreSQL') in the table have the exact same casing. If the casing might vary (e.g., 'python', 'tableau'), you might need to use a case-insensitive comparison function depending on your database system (e.g., `LOWER()` or `UPPER()`).
* **Data Quality:** The accuracy of the results depends on the quality of the data in the `candidates` table. If there are typos or inconsistencies in the skill names, the query might not identify all the correct candidates.
* **Scalability:** For very large datasets, the performance of the query might become a concern. In such cases, ensuring proper indexing on the `candidate_id` and `skill` columns is crucial.
* **Number of Required Skills:** The provided solution is easily adaptable if the number of required skills changes. You would just need to modify the `WHERE IN` clause and the `HAVING COUNT(skill) =` condition.
