## Question:
Given a table of Facebook posts, for each user who posted at least twice in 2021, write a query to find the number of days between each userâ€™s first post of the year and last post of the year in the year 2021. Output the user and number of the days between each user's first and last post.

## `posts` Table:
| Column Name | Type      |
|-------------|-----------|
| `user_id`   | integer   |
| `post_id`   | integer   |
| `post_content`| text      |
| `post_date` | timestamp |

## `posts` Example Input:
| user_id | post_id | post_content                                                                         | post_date             |
|---------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| 151652  | 599415  | Need a hug                                                                           | 07/10/2021 12:00:00   |

## Example Output:
| user_id | days_between |
|---------|--------------|
| 151652  | 2            |
| 661093  | 21           |

*The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - this is just an example!*

## Solution:
```sql
WITH user_posts_2021 AS (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        post_date
    FROM
        posts
    WHERE
        EXTRACT(YEAR FROM post_date) = 2021
),
user_post_counts AS (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        COUNT(*) AS post_count
    FROM
        user_posts_2021
    GROUP BY
        user_id
),
frequent_users AS (
    SELECT
        user_id
    FROM
        user_post_counts
    WHERE
        post_count >= 2
)
SELECT
    f.user_id,
    DATE_PART('day', MAX(up.post_date) - MIN(up.post_date)) AS days_between
FROM
    frequent_users f
JOIN
    user_posts_2021 up ON f.user_id = up.user_id
GROUP BY
    f.user_id;
```

Or Try this simple *solution*

```sql
SELECT user_id,
MAX(post_date::DATE) - MIN(post_date::DATE) AS days_between
FROM posts
GROUP BY user_id
HAVING COUNT(post_id)>1;
